2013-05-09,Great Lakes Airlines,WP6pvnTaIp5zO7Tv7Sr85Q,5,"So I've seen a few bad write-ups on Great Lakes Airlines and I am not doubting the legibility of the claims but I had a wonderful experience. First of all, they are the only airline that flies me from Phoenix to Show Low to see my girlfriend. Second, and this is where I see a lot of complaints, is the delays. Neither my departure or arrival were late, I was in the plane with my seatbelt on at the time of departure promised. The staff on and off the plane were very friendly and even though the planes are small and outdated, my flight was only 40 minutes so I can't complain. I would definitely recommend choosing this airline."
2013-10-07,Great Lakes Airlines,ftE8hHJv6cbJ54WJ_9fpdw,1,"Cancelled flight at the last minute!!!!! not because of weather, but because of eqipment failure.   the agents were very helpful but that doesnt take away the annoyance of ""no more flights today""."
2014-06-05,Great Lakes Airlines,m51oCfRiKJGmO_k6kqZSDw,1,"WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. 
WOULD NOT LET ME ON THE FLIGHT BECAUSE THEY OVERBOOKED IT, AND THEN REFUSED TO REFUND ME AND MY FAMILY....EVEN THOUGH I HAD A REFUNDABLE TICKET. 
Bought flight tickets in January for a trip down the Grand Canyon that left the following morning at 6am. They canceled our flight in March and rescheduled us for a later flight. Then 3 days prior to our flight they told us they overbooked our flight and could only take 9 out of the 11 people they booked. After more than 15 calls to them including the corporate headquarters they said they absolutely would not compensate us for having to drive to our destination now, there was no way they could guarantee our flight unless arrived onsite 24 hours in advance (no more no less), and that they had no idea if or how they could refund our flight. Despite us having to miss our entire trip that cost thousands of dollars by telling us 3 days prior to our departure that they are unable to take us to our destination. They are also unfortunately the only airline that flys into this site. We arrived 3 hours before the plane took off, but they would not let us on the plane, and refused to refund our tickets. We lost all of the money, were stranded in page, and had to spend 400$ on a one way rental care to page. I would rather drive anywhere than deal with this airline ever again. Worst customer service. I can't imagine a less reliable company....in any part of the world."
2014-06-05,Great Lakes Airlines,14GOs_N5qNaUTGxIYIJpLA,1,"One word -- NIGHTMARE!!!!!!

Of all of the businesses I have ever dealt with this business was by far the worst experience I have ever had -- and I am a business owner myself!!!

Let's start from the top:

1. We (my wife and I) book our fight in January of 2014 to fly from Phoenix, AZ to Page, AZ to go white water rafting down the Grand Canyon with my father in law. For those of you who aren't familiar, those rafting trips have to be booked a year in advance, for private trips often multiple years in advance with a lottery for who can raft it (population caps on the trips).

2. Four Days before the flight Great Lakes tells us that it is now FIRST COME FIRST SERVE ON THE FLIGHT!!!! Wait what? First come first serve seating? NO FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BOARDING!!! If we don't get there before the other passenger's we're screwed, and if we do get there before them they are screwed. 

3. We had already booked flights with Southwest so we knew we would only arrive an hour before the other passengers.  Needless to say we did not get there in time to get a seat on the plane. 

NEXT you would expect Great Lakes to say ""oh sorry we couldn't get you a seat, let's get you a refund -- and some compensation for the $400 and 7 hour car ride you are now going to have to spend on a rental. Did we get that? OF COURSE NOT! 

Did we even get a refund? NOPE! 

Luckily we were able to get our credit card company to reverse the charges otherwise I would have likely called their phone number once a day to tell them to quit their jobs.

Like I said -- NIGHTMARE!!!!!"
2012-03-23,Swift Aviation Services,R5Rr7UOgAbUB8lrRJyKqaQ,4,"This is one of the largest and most extensive FBOs I've ever been to in the country and they haven't let the size go to their head either.

They offer up prompt, friendly and thorough service while smiling and enjoying the sunshine (or the shade in their gigantic shade hangar). Their facilities are second to none and the catering that I've received through them has been quite tasty. 

I really enjoy coming here despite the fact that it's in Phoenix."
2013-12-28,Swift Aviation Services,KrA1pmfS_RYv9pGRNJhE7w,2,"0100 arrival for 150 gal of Jet A and a quick turn. Scruffy, unshaven CSA, dressed in ratty hooded sweatshirt did not project a professional image. When asked, there was no change available for a $20.00 bill for vending machine. Not the level of service expected from a high end FBO. We'll make another facility choice next time."
2009-12-10,Alaska Airlines,8O5zXnbICRt25s8bBGonmQ,5,"I use to fly a lot but as the cost raises and terror took the skies I stopped. I however flew Alaska Airlines one way from Seattle to Phoenix to transport my beloved dog. They are still the best! Their pet transport fee is still the lowest when your pet travels at the same time you do. When I got to my seat there was a post-a-note saying I'm on board too! That reassured me, and others like me that our pet was on the plane. I thought that was such a sweet and thoughtful touch. Kudos Alaska Airline! I flew you also because many trips between Seattle and Alaska with my prior dog had been successful and horror free. You know how to take care of our fury members, as well as the rest of us and you do it at fairer fare than the others.
Your cleaning staff is awesome after the flight they get in there and tidy things up for the next group, find and turn in our forgotten items like my L.G. Lotus phone and quickly get it to us before we leave the airport! When I went to claim my baggage and dog your porter took the work out of it by having all my belongings and my dog gathered and ready to go curbside for my pick up! The porter  checked to make sure my dog was mine and even minded my bags while I took my dog to the PHX doggie walk at the airport to relieve herself! All in all I felt I and my canine companion were looked out for like we were more than just a head count  from the start to the end of the trip. Further more all my belongings including my computer and camera equipment in my checked in baggage came to me undisturbed and undamaged. I thank you a thousand times for your kid gloves to my personal belongings and with my dog. I'll be flying with you again."
2010-08-31,Alaska Airlines,Bs5tFgy7-0HQlB-w0MsJHQ,4,I just found a ticket to Oregon for $220.  This unbeleiveable price compared the other Phoenix airline options.  I will know be checking Alaska more often when I go out of town.  Looking forward to the trip.  Thanks Alaska for making it more affordable.
2011-11-26,Alaska Airlines,PG73m_yuKeOhv3t2tDgpmg,4,"I travel constantly and have flown pretty much everyone from JAL, Air India to local carriers like SeaPort Air. The best way I can describe AA... I don't always fly big air, but when I do, I fly Alaska Air. lol

AA is a great carrier and I try to take them when I can."
2012-06-13,Alaska Airlines,nVpJb4CfaldJYrekSCUbgA,5,Just wanted to give a shout out to the awesome crew on our recent flight from SEA - PHX!
2012-07-01,Alaska Airlines,qEeTKbhpdZBJZmoQuLFAww,4,"I really like flying Alaska Air, for a few reasons:
1) it's out of Terminal 2, which means a quick walk in/walk out, almost no wait in line, easy bag check-in and easy baggage claim.
2) I have almost always experienced pleasant stewards on all AK flights... for the most part genuinely friendly, prompt, and of good spirits
3) Alaska Air (one of my favorite aspects) is all about recycling and using local or at least AK, HI, or Pacific Northwest-based businesses for their on-board food/drinks for sale - this is such a pleasure to see and it makes me want to continue doing business with them
4) $20 baggage check-in fee... $5 cheaper than USAir.. not bad
5) When I've upgraded to First Class upon check-in in the past, it's costed me $50/leg of my itinerary - score!!

This is why I like Alaskan Air!"
2012-08-10,Alaska Airlines,Hd6inIP3Tfe611kDHjMr1g,1,"I used to hear that Alaska airline was good b/c they are usually on time with schedule. Maybe this is true, but gosh their customer service is horrendous. I mean I've flown a fair amount in my life. Not just in the US, but also overseas with some sketchy airlines. But by far, Alaska airlines had one of the worst customer service and did not help out a passenger. It seems as though, their company motto is ""You are on your own"" type of mentality. 

The problem started when I arrived 30mins prior to my flight and had already checked in online a day before. I was not checking in any bags, so all I had to do was get a reprint of my boarding pass to go through security. Too bad, nobody was a the counter to help me out and the kiosk would not let me print out my pass. So I was just sitting ducks outside the security line just watching my plane take off while I could not do anything. 

When I eventually got a hold of the customer service agent, there was no remorse. I tried to tell them that I was there 30mins early and had already checked in online a day before. Plus they didn't have ANYONE at the ticket counter. But those facts did not matter to them. They never apologized and never offered for any help. All they were busy doing was to blame me for not showing up an hour earlier. 

Well it's save to say that I will NEVER fly Alaska airlines if I could and I would never recommend this airline. Worst customer service ever."
2012-12-11,Alaska Airlines,VJiIS7V7y-fVku0sZab3WA,4,Very friendly on air staff and both flights landed early!  That's the best! Downside was our flight didn't have a movie and you have to pay to use the wifi.
2013-09-12,Alaska Airlines,Wytm1NJEwO5zpUed_0Stxg,5,"My husband and I recently used Alaska Air to relocate to Hawaii with our 9 pets.  

With such an unusual case, we expected difficulties, but they were great.  The reps on the phone were extremely helpful, accommodating, and nice. 

When we arrived in Chicago the lady was very thorough checking us in, and made us feel comfortable leaving our pets in her capable hands.

The Seattle airport was the same good experience.  We really appreciated they provide cards for each of our pets to let us know they were all boarded.

The flight attendants on each flight seemed genuinely nice, and responded to all our inquiries regarding our pets.

We really appreciated their care towards our pets.  

We will definitely use them again when we visit family back on the mainland."
2013-10-14,Alaska Airlines,i0_9msMhWlHo-JjoVOtBsg,4,"Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again."
2014-01-07,Alaska Airlines,XJIpaivtXn5n1-GtnIexiw,5,"Everytime I fly they're always on time, if not early! The flight attendants are the friendliest, nicest and most helpful than other airlines I've flown. They go above and beyond with customer service--even when I've spoken with them on the phone! Now, I only fly with Alaska Airline. I've never been disappointed in the last 13 years of frequent flying!"
2014-01-25,Alaska Airlines,HaVjOLpbBK0L1tz9rMIq6Q,5,"Simply the best, I just wish they flew to more places out of Phoenix!  Going out of Terminal 2 is easy and convenient, the people are friendly, the planes are clean and new (unlike the garbage on Southwest and USAirways), and their ticket prices are reasonable.   Definitely worth trying if you've never flown them before.  I'm a fan!"
2014-06-27,Alaska Airlines,KQ5oW4CRO4Z0wfHObK7IMQ,2,"Congratulations Alaska Airlines. After not allowing me to check in online you denied me a ticket because I was one minute past the cutoff. I fly all over the world and this happens occasionally but I have never been denied. So I will sleep in the airport tonight when a bit of caring by your personnel could have avoided this. I have flown with you whenever possible but never again.
My fault for not knowing the shuttle uses were dedicated to specific terminals"
2009-02-06,Delta Airlines,dygK0OZaDU_8H6BrXiJA_g,1,"delta airlines is one of the worst airlines out there. my flight out of PVD was delayed, sat on the runway for a good 20mins when we arrived in ATL, they forced all of the passengers to do planeside valet bc the overhead bins were smaller than normal so i had to wait another 20mins for my luggage. these series of events caused me to miss my connecting flight to PHX. none of the delta representatives and managers cared. there were no more flights out to PHX that night and they were not willing to provide hotel accomodations and/or a meal voucher so i was stuck in the ATL airport overnight. seriously, one of the worst experiences EVER and i fly a lot. 

0* if i could!!!!"
2010-06-20,Delta Airlines,8OwjGd1hbUJybfBCH4J-_Q,1,"Had flight from Phoenix to Salt Lake that was delayed over 90 minutes.  I got a call at 4:30 am to inform me of this with a message.  This delay caused me to miss my connection by just a few minutes.  I had to wait an extra 3 hours in Salt Lake.  They should have waited 15 minutes since they were the ones late.  The Salt Lake flight was also late by 30 minutes!  They gave me a $6 voucher for a meal which is not even enough for a salad at the airport! That cost $9. The return flight was also late but since there was a 3 hour layover I did not miss my connecting flight.  I they are late they should delay the connecting flight instead of making me wait 3 hours.  Delta treats their customers not like customers but like cargo.  This was my first and last time flying Delta. 3 out of 4 flights late, not acceptable, and they leave you holding the bag!"
2010-07-25,Delta Airlines,ae81kqsRhNGJGRYtrWOPyg,1,"*** no.
Stay away.

Plane was not clean.
They cut corners sacrificing quality.
Food is beyond crappy.
I'm sure some ppl's dogs get better food than that.

My last straw:
They lost my luggage and it took them *THREE WEEKS* to find it and deliver it to my place.
My sh*t arrived wet. Thanks Delta. I'll wear my soggy undies you bas***s.

Not to mention the flight delays which messes with the connection flights."
2010-08-08,Delta Airlines,tjopNJVCRg6xlKXn9YapbQ,1,"Okay, did I say bad??
WORSE.
Negative five stars.

From San Diego,
1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.
2. Made us go check our bags

3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the ""special needs"" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight. 

4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.
She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).

5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off.
6. ""mechanical problems"".
7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.
8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.

9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)

10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.
11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.
12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me? 
13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE. 

~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:

LAX to Tokyo: ""mechanical problems""
stayed another hour on the plane.
Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere.
Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!

Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.

Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?!
Sorry Delta, I'm so exhausted, sick and tired of you.
F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too."
2011-03-19,Delta Airlines,BALyRDY2X6v4ix1fRbAZ3A,1,"I've had way too many negative experiences with Delta to list them all individually, but they include rude/lazy employees, delayed and/or cancelled flights, numerous lost bags, substandard aircraft and facilities. 

It would seem that since they purchased Northwest, their service has only gone downhill. I spoke with a customer service agent last week to ask them to waive a $150 ""Change Fee"" for my elderly mother, and after refusing to help, I kid you not, he told me ""We don't need your business."" 

So long as passengers continue to tolerate this kind of treatment, Delta will continue to take advantage of us."
2013-10-17,Delta Airlines,ki_w6eXIy6tCEH-iVEXCPw,1,"Why anyone is still willing to fly Delta is beyond me!  The employees at every step of the following story were rude or just didn't give a sh*t, and it showed.

I booked a trip to Kona from Phoenix.  My flight from Phoenix to LAX was delayed, I felt lucky the flight at the gate next to us was being canceled.  We got to LAX late and I missed my connection to Hawaii.  They decided to re-book me on an American Airlines flight instead.  I hate American Airlines almost as much as Delta, and was not impressed.  Almost missed the new flight because Delta and American are in Different terminals and it takes quite a bit of time to get to other terminals at LAX.  Fortunately the flight was delayed while I was still in Security line and I finally made it to Kona.

Then there was the return trip.  I had to change my flight due to a need to get home sooner than I planned.  They charged me $200 change fee, even though my new flight was a less expensive flight than my original flight, fine, I need to get home.  

Get to the airport in Kona, Delta charges me for my luggage, of course it is expected, but it matters later.  So all the passengers a re waiting for out Delta flight to LAX, and of course as I have come to expect from Delta, the flight is delayed.  We finally get to board, about have the plane is boarded and they stop the boarding process, and bring in mechanics electrical issue.  after sitting there for an hour they decide we can fly and finish the boarding and taxi out.  As we are taxiing the electrical system flickers pretty substantially and we are shortly told by the pilot we are taxiing back.  We are told that the mechanics will need all passengers off the plane to test the systems and we are all booted back to the waiting area.  By this time the airport has closed and as we are being returned to the secure waiting area,  they turn off the lights.  It takes 10 minutes and someone is finally able to get the lights back on.  But the agriculture inspectors have left so we are confined to the area.  

Delta is thoughtful enough to provide Water and snacks for us since it still 80 degrees and  being the kona airport we are outside.  Unfortunately, they brought water and enough potato chips for about  half of the 196 people that are trying to get to LAX.  We are held hostage by Delta Airlines in the secure area for about 3 hours, the mechanics are saying the plane is not fit to fly, and Delta Corporate refuses to cancel the flight.  We were hostages.  

Finally The flight is canceled and we are shuffled to the original ticketing desk to get vouchers for a hotel and transportation.  There are 2 people to help the 196 passengers.  We are given 2 $10 transportation vouchers, 3 $10 meal vouchers, a voucher for the Hotel, and a little card that says ""Need Help?  Call Delta... "" and told to call that number in the morning to get re-booked.   Then we are sent to the baggage claim to get our bags and told that a bus will be arriving to take us to the hotel we have been given a room at.  

The ""bus"" was a 6 person shuttle van, just one.  There were almost 200 people to move to downtown Kona, and one 6 person shuttle to take us all.  The taxis refused to accept the vouchers, and were charging up to $70 per trip to downtown (that is an issue for my review of the City of Kaliua-Kona).  All of the Delta employees had gone home and we we abandoned at the curb.  So another 2 hours go by and I finally get a rid to the hotel.  In the mean time while waiting my turn I called the help line and got booked on a flight home, but too late to make the appointment that required me to change my flight in the first place.  

I get checked into my room at the hotel at 5:45 am and need to be back at the airport by 10:45 am to be able to get on my re-booked flight, with another airline.  I slept for a few hours and then went to use one of my vouchers and get a bite, nope couldn't use it.  Bought a coffee and went to hotel concierge and explained I needed a ride to the airport, and that I have a voucher.  She laughed and told me I wouldn't find a ride that way and that she would be happy to get me a cab, but I would need to pay cash and they figure it at about $45 to the airport.  

When I finally get back to the airport, the new airline charges me a luggage fee, apparently Delta doesn't pay them so I have to.  The flight is delayed an hour.  Call Delta Help and am advised that they have me booked on another airline and I will not miss the flight.  

I did make the flight and made it home.  The total out of pocket for my trouble with Delta airlines was $380.  on top of the original flight cost.  Delta has been steadfast in refusing a refund of any of the extra costs.  I will be filing complaints with every agency that will listen, and some of the local news stations.  I know it was a long story, but take it as a warning... DO NOT FLY DELTA!!"
2013-12-18,Delta Airlines,vEEPrimm5UjZPuK3wZbepQ,1,"Delta is apparently winning well deserved awards for lousy service! The NWA/Delta merger has not changed poor management and disenchanted, simply awful employees. When I mentioned my family Delta experience on my Facebook page, there was not one comment that was favorable. Like I have said before the management and rank and file rejects who could not make it for employment at Southwest, populate the staff at Delta.Delta- home of the rejected!!!!!!!!!"
2006-06-24,US Airways,FBERg90d6NGVPA_O9K0avg,1,"Horrible!! I took US Airways coming back home from a business trip, in which I had to take connecting flights from DCA to PHX to SFO. My flight was supposed to leave at 7:30pm from PHX and when I go to check-in (upon arrival from DCA), they tell me that my bags from my connecting flight were put on a later flight at 11:00 pm! I even showed them my confirmation/receipt printed out and they told me they couldn't do anything because my bags were put on a later flight to SFO.

To top it all off, instead of the nice aisle seat I originally requested on a bigger plane, I got stuck boarding a mini one with a seat in Siberia, next to the lavatory door that wouldn't close and the attendant had to use a pen to keep it shut during take-off. My seat was soiled and the window cover was cracked and you couldn't even pull it down because it was being held up by a crumpled piece of newspaper. It was so uncomfortable and dirty, I didn't even want to lean back into my seat. I almost cried. I've sat on cleaner seats in the BART. HORRIBLE!! Never again."
2006-07-03,US Airways,wSzIfVuRz2UuLjYFk_9SLQ,2,"US Air is better than Southwest.   But that's not really a compliment.  

Here is the deal.   My work finish early today so we wanted to see if we could exchange our first class tickets from the 4:30 flight  to the flight at 1:30 which still had lots of empty seats in first class.   The gal at the call center said sure, but the change fee would be $100 per person and an addition fee would be imposed for a one way ticket.   Of course, explaining to her that we were just changing the return leg of our ticket home did not constitute a one way ticket.   She informed us that it did... and to the tune of about $400 each.  So, to save 3 hours would have cost us a cool grand.   Nope.  No thanks, but spank you very much for trying that with us.   

Oh, it gets better.  We are not seated together in first which is not a big deal.  But we get there 2 hours early and ask to be put together.   The friendly gal at the check in desk says, sure no problem.  Then proceeds to take both our tickets and change my travel companions tickets twice.   So once again, we are seated apart.   We only know this because 30 minutes before we are to board, we read through the boarding passes.  Both were in her name.  Nice.   Oh, BTW, the plane was delayed an hour with no explanation and no warning.   Thanks.   

So, realizing the problem, the gate attendant says, yeah, you aren't sitting next to one another.   We, kindly informed her that we were supposed to because when we got our tickets that' s the set up we wanted.   Her reply was to tell the flight attendants and maybe they could do something on the plane.   To make a long story short, because one older lady was kind enough to move, we got to sit next to one another.   In flight, the flight crew took good care of us.   I can't complain about them at all.   They were top notch, but the ground crew isn't supporting them.   

Oh and to top it off, when we arrived, it took 30 minutes to get our one checked bag despite the bright ""Priority"" tag on it.   I guess that doesn't mean much anymore.   

C'mon ground crews, get your act together.   Follow the lead of the Flight Crew and give a hoot about your customers."
2006-07-10,US Airways,Wpa5kCtSOa7dVoM3gTfOVw,2,"Lost baggage and poor child wrangling. It's all about employee empowerment.

I have the patience of the Madonna - all right maybe more like the Material Girl - but I am pretty laid back. After my humbling experience in the wine industry, I've been much more appreciative of service industry related jobs. But when employees are not empowered to answer the most simple of questions, and we're checking in on machines with nobody around to handle luggage, well...it's a disaster waiting to happen. It's an unfortunate thing that is supposed to help in keeping costs down and help with efficiency - but there's been consistent problems with all of my US AIRWAYS flights.

Let's throw JFK airport into the mix to help maximize the disaster...we ended up in Orlando. Waiting for our luggage. Luckily our toddler was entertained with the luggage roundabout...because we waited through two flight arrivals to retrieve one bag. 

Family that met up with us for the 4th assured us US AIRWAYS used a really efficient delivery service...Apparently the lost luggage situation is pretty common.

Good thing the baby bug is a trooper when it comes to traveling - because Orlando trips tend to be family-heavy and the on-board US AIRWAYS staff consistently doesn't seem too thrilled to be dealing with even the well-behaved ones."
2006-08-07,US Airways,k9dxqzTrhHkZa8Dq6Zf0Ug,2,"I was an optimist when the America West / US Airways merger news hit the airwaves.  Unfortunately I was a bit too hopeful.  I've traveled a lot for work (and pleasure) so it made sense to stay loyal to one airline and become ""Gold Elite"" to take advantage of the benefits, namely lots of first-class upgrades, no lines, bonus miles, etc.  

A string of events (I won't bore you with the unethical and deceitful details) that took place last week on what was to be an easy non-stop flight from SFO to PHX cemented my negative feelings.  Since the merger took place prices have risen dramatically,  customer service has dropped substantially, and the sunny Arizona airline has been infiltrated with dreary East Coast attitudes.  The stock has tumbled and the outlook is not good.  Everything seemed to be on the up and up before there was any talk of a merger.  

Strangely, America West bought out US Airways.  How did they let this demise transpire?  From now on it looks like Kayak.com will decide my airline and flights."
2006-09-19,US Airways,aGlizBc_zHBi_3AMplN8iw,1,"So, I fly a lot., nearly 70,000 miles in the past 6 months. Not usually US Airways/America West - only maybe 5 or 6 times with them. But my ONLY horrible airline experiences have both been with them., which is quite a ratio.

1. Flew from San Diego to Portland meeting up for a month-long concert tour. I had  my personal things as well as music/sound equipment. Of course, when I land, my luggage didn't. After spending at least an hour trying to get baggage services to help me - they say my luggage is on the next flight, and they will have a courier deliver it to me. I make abundantly clear that I will meet the courier and have it personally handed to me - I don't want it left with security/staff/anyone else (we were at a large rock venue).  They promised to call as soon as my luggage landed, and again when the courier was en route and they would only deliver to me personally.

Of course, no call. And I called every hour on the hour till 4 in the morning (when we left for the next city on the tour) - and couldn't get an answer or a call back. Not only did they not call me as promised, OR return any my calls, they apparently DID deliver my bags, but just left them on the door of the venue - EXACTLY what I had stressed not to do. I found this out the next day after calling repeatedly - when we were already in another city. Nobody signed for them even. Never saw my bags again, lost a ton of important gear I needed for work, and was screwed. And then? A HUGE a huge fight with them over the claim. They dishonored the claim for a while since they said they delivered them to the address I specified - despite having a promise in writing to deliver to me by hand. Then they said my claim was with the courier company, not the airline.Then they didn't want to cover anything but clothing and hygiene items.

2. Flew from St. Louis to Flagstaff. Had a layover in Phoenix - which is only like a 2 hour drive from Flagstaff. The flight in Phoenix was delayed several hours - but they didn't announce the delay until 10 minutes to boarding - and kept delaying it by just 20 minutes at a time. Finally, once we board we are told the flight MAY be not be able to land in Flagstaff due to bad weather. The kicker? They won't send us back to Phoenix - we would be diverted to Palm Springs California - and since it was ""an act of god"" - we were on our own. They weren't responsible for lodging, return airfare, refunds, ground transport - nothing. So - the whole plane is already pissed about being delayed so long, and now this. Nobody wants to take the chance of being flown to another state and getting stuck - so literally all but maybe 2 people deplane and mill around the tarmack. 

Then we  find out that we can choose not to take the flight, but if we checked baggage - we can't retrieve it! It's going to either Flagstaff or Palm Springs with or without us!  So some people start to get back on the plane, and others are arguing on the tarmack about what to do about their bags. I spot our bags just sitting in the open cargo door of the plane, and lead a small army of angry passengers to the back of the plane and  we just grab our bags that were in plain sight. The flight attendant tried to stop us - but realized that people were pissed, and we greatly outnumbered them. 

I ended up just renting  a car and driving the 2 hours to Flagstaff. And apparently flights to Flagstaff had been cancelled all day - but they neglected to tell us that.  At least they could have given a heads-up to us so that we could have not waited nearly 4 hours on flight delays and driven ourselves there much faster. No apologies, no refunds, nothing. 

I primarily fly either United, Southwest, or Jet Blue. No horror stories from them - while yes they've lost a bag here or there, they've always been professional and prompt in getting it to me."

I have few complaints about the flights, except they're expensive to fly direct from SFO to Pittsburgh, even though they're ""a low cost carrier"". The whole different check in line for flights from SFO to LAS/PHX and PIT/CLT /PHL is kinda weird too.

2007-06-27,US Airways,o2_XIY_-L03dw_KYT8JNLA,1,"*I am posting this on every site possible for United, US Airways & Continental.  My hatred of them all is so consuming that I am dedicating two days to vent my venom and expound upon the disgusting experiences I just had.  I'm normally a nice person, but they pushed every button possible.*

I now call the ""Star Alliance"" of airlines ""The Death Star Alliance."" I have never been treated so horribly as by United, US Airways and Continental.

My great idea to take our 10 month old son to visit all the Grandparents turned into the trip from hell. Much like ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" meets ""The Out-of-Towners"" we encountered almost every possible problem an airline can throw at you. We flew on seven flights, drove 450 miles unexpectedly, got sick and were injured. To add insult to injury, my infant was nearly strip searched at one check point and I was photographed for a blog on travel misery. (I cut quite a figure with a car seat strapped to my back, stroller, laptop and diaper bag while bolting to make a connection at O'Hare.)

Each leg was late departing and arriving. We missed connections and stood in lines for hours trying to get alternate flights. Our upgrades were ""lost"", we were re-routed to airports not on our route, only to have those flights canceled. Our baggage was locked up in storage, lost or sent to the wrong terminal.

The final straw was sitting on the tarmac for 4 1/2 hours for a shuttle flight between Newark and Norfolk only to have the flight canceled. We were then put on a flight to Richmond that was also canceled. The customer service desk shut down leaving everyone stranded with no hotels, transportation or food, since the airport restaurants also shut down. With no alternative flights available for two days, I had to rent a car at a distant location (none at the airport) and drive to North Carolina.

Don't get me started on the lousy equipment. One plane kept losing power so we couldn't get off. Yet another lost air conditioning and condensation was raining from the ceiling. As if that weren't enough, the last flight's seat cushions weren't attached to the frame so the shot off like slip 'n slide toys.

The flight crews ranged from angry to scary. My husband had scalding tea dumped on him. One stewardess lost her shoe and was crawling up and down the aisle looking for it. Another was like Nurse Ratchett patrolling the passengers.

I got a gushing nose bleed on one flight and had to be iced to keep from flooding the plane. I had to change my son on the lid of the toilet of one of the filthiest bathrooms I've seen outside of the third world (and I've been to the third world). My husband contracted some pestilence from his first flight. I got an eye stye on my third of six flights - a staph infection from the bathroom I suspect.

They whammied us to the end with our connection home from Dulles to LAX missed while we sat on the tarmac yet again. We managed to get three standby seats on the last bucket of bolts out to LAX. When we arrived, half of the luggage was MIA...ours went to a different terminal, but at least it got there.

You know when even the stewardesses are p*ssed, the airline has a problem.

DOWN WITH THE ""DEATH STAR ALLIANCE"" - MAY ALL THE EXECUTIVES AND MANAGERS OF THE AIRLINES BE THROWN ON THEIR OWN STINKY PLANES AND HELD HOSTAGE WITHOUT FOOD OR OPERATIONAL TOILETS FOR 48 HOURS AND MAYBE THEN, THEY'LL KNOW THE MISERY THEY INFLICT ON THEIR HIGH PAYING CUSTOMERS.

Okay, so we start with five stars.
-Subtract one for an hour and a half delay on a 1/2 hour COMMUTER flight
-Subtract one for snarky, micromanaging flight attendants 
-Subtract one for two agents rescheduling a total of 6 customers in an hour
-Subtract one for a code-shared flight in another terminal
-Subtract one for giving customers the WRONG TERMINAL so they have to travel to two terminals and get through security to find the flight they originally had ten minutes to catch... which also is late.

I have flown 4 times with US Airways over the past two years and not one of my trips didn't have some kind of delay.

I was delayed for almost 6-hours coming back from San Francisco, and over three hours from Phoenix to Vegas (I could have driven quicker than the total one way trip time of 5hrs). What gets me is their lack of communication - It's like a complete mystery to them when the flight will actually take off...

All airlines seem to be having major difficulties being on time lately... Why is this such an issue in the last few years? I would gladly pay an additional $25 per flight to be SURE that it would be on time - wouldn't that motivate airlines to step up their game? On time guarantees and partial refunds for more then 30min delays?

I HAVE to write this review, as I had an awful experience with them yesterday.  I was scheduled at 7:23am out of Phoenix and arriving back here in SF at 9:30 am in enough time for work at 11am.  I arrive, and proceed to the E check-in.   The computer starts having ""issues"" and so I try to get the attendants attention and I failed.  Knowing I didn't have a lot of time before we depart, I decided to to to the counter check-in.   I waited 5 minutes before getting to the counter only to be told that I was no longer on this flight b/c it was less than 30 minutes before departure!  WHAT???  I have a carry on ANNNNND that computer right there (pointing at it) has something wrong with it and that is why I came through your line.  It was 25 minutes to departure and she refused to check me in!!  Again, I ONLY had a carry on.  It didn't matter to her that I had to be at work at 11am.  Arriving in SF later than 9:30 am was NOT AN OPTION for me.  She hastily said, ""you can try and get through security and see if maybe they'll let you on the flight.  That is all I will do for you!""

I finally get through security and get to the gate at EXACTLY 7:22am, one minute to spare, begging the customer services reps to let me on the flight or I was going to lose my job.  

They of course told me NO.  The flight was delayed 2 hours and I was late anyway!!!  Ahhhhh...

Thankfully, the flight attendant had a lot of personality and was very accommodating to me, even if I was 1.5 hours late for work.  

I wish I had the name of that lady in the Phoenix airport downstairs at the check in desk.  I mean, when I pointed to the computer that was giving me problems, there was a tech guy working on it and she saw him.  Even seeing him, she still wouldn't accommodate me in any way and was rude about it.  Poor customer service!  I WON'T be flying this airline again, I can tell you that. 

I was not only blown away by their complete lack of care for me and the ""issues"" I was having with their E-check-in computer, but also the lack of  ""social"" skills one needs when working in customer service.  Eye contact!!"

The flight attendants were so rude on my last flight that it shocked me. 

And now you want to charge me $30 for an aisle seat. Fuck you!

Downgraded a star for the new baggage policy.

On the bright side, now US Airways' baggage policy of one free checked bag seems like a bargain compared to American's new policy.  Surely US will be following suit soon, but until then...

We had a major problem coming home from vacation a few weeks ago-- the plane was delayed by about 4 hours, which meant that we would miss our connection in Charlotte so we'd be put up in a hotel overnight.  Yes, we were annoyed, but I wouldn't want to be on a plane with mechanical problems and there was nothing anyone could do, so we made the best of it.  The customer service in our departing city was pretty abysmal, but much better in Charlotte, where a kind lady put us in first class for our flight back to LGA the next morning.

I forgave them after we were put up in a reasonably nice motel and enjoyed endless juice and blankets and pillows on the plane.  What makes for the three star, overall positive review is that upon our arrival home, we each received an apologetic email and a $50 travel voucher.  I was impressed at this gesture.

US Airways is not responsible for the most annoying part of the ordeal, which was a jappy girl dressed in 3 sweaters (we were leaving a Caribbean island!) and complaining endlessly to her boyfriend about how she could have done the US Airways clerks' jobs better than them.

What Carolynne R. said about being bullied, I definitely wouldn't doubt it. It personally didn't happen to me, but I did witness several people get yelled at and lectured by the lady behind the counter. People were already distraught that their first U.S. Airway flight landed late....throwing them off by a few minutes, but to yell at them when they find out that they can't board the plane?...that's pretty messed up.  Flying alone, I DEFINITELY wouldn't have known wth to do...and I know that her attitude would have made me feel 10 times worse. 

Customer service sure as hell doesn't seem like a priority for some of these people. Good thing I didn't have to deal with them at the counter.

I cannot complain about the rate... $237 round trip is cheap these days. However, you are nickel-and-dimed for luggage check-in, a coke, snacks, etc. I limited myself  to just one small suitcase, which added $15 each way. (Thankfully I did not exceed the luggage weight or there would have been another fee.) A second suitcase would have been an additional $25.

So fair experience overall, HOWEVER, I discovered that passengers can bring cats and dogs on the airplane. Maybe I have been living in a cave, but how is this even possible? First of all I am severely allergic to cats, and I know I am not the only one out there because that is a very common allergy. Guess where the little feline was?! You guessed it, right under my seat. For whatever reason I seemed to not have much of an allergic reaction. I am not sure if it was the recirculated air in the airplane or what. 

I did ask the flight attendant if they were indeed allowed. She replied with a plastic and enthusiastic smile ""Oh yes! We allow cats and dogs and have for quite some time."" No doubt she probably had a cat at home. I inquired about the possibility of the animals peeing or worse! Again with the plastic smile, she explained they are in carriers -- as if that solves this biological need. Really????  I don't know about you, but I am not crazy about being trapped 10,000 feet up having to smell cat urine on a 4-hour flight. How is that allowed? How does that meet health codes?

The worst US airline, ever. 

I flew USAirways last night from Houston to San Francisco, connecting in Phoenix, ONLY b/c I was 1,500 miles from maintaining my Premier status with United, and it was a necessary evil. However, it was a DRAMATICALLY different experience from my now usual delightful experience flying direct on Continental. 

Unlike Continental, where the flight attendants are nice, courteous, and professional, where they give you complimentary drinks, where they have newer planes, where they often have your own TV with free movies in the backs of the seats, and unlike where they feed you meals for free, US Airways sucks on ALL these points.

First, I was bumbed by the flight attendant as she came through with the beverage cart - what ever happened to announcing to keep elbows in as they came throught he aisles?

Then, she flung some small chunks of ice at me (as she was getting a man his drink). Neither of these times did she apologize. 

Oh, and did I mention they're now apparently charging for a coke ($2)? Or even a water? Rip-off!

They charge money for soggy chicken salad sandwiches, and a ridiculous price for a preservative-infested snack box.

There are obnoxious advertisements on the tray tables. 

Lastly, on the leg from PHX to SFO, there was a broken seat a couple aisles in front of me! Full-on, bent over seat back, folded in half. Really? You don't have money to properly maintain your planes?

2008-12-31,US Airways,1NhWpTj35bhAf0_MhKm19A,1,"USAirways?  I don't think so scooter!  They don't even deserve to have US in their name, because first of all, it's not about US, it's about THEM.  Secondly, they are a disgrace and an embarassment to this country.  

Where should I start?  I was going a mere 650 air (900 land) miles to Durango, CO from San Diego, CA with a connecting flight in Phoenix.  After boarding the plane, they inform us there is a machanical problem with the auxillary power unit (a common problem on the old POS Airbus planes!!), and they would have to manually start the engines on the ground.  Not sure what this meant, I was nervous and frantically googling on my iphone to make sure the plane was safe to fly without it.  Fortunately, it was, but unfortunately for all of us low passengers waiting to take off, we had no air circulation in the cabin until after the plane took off because that's one of the many things the APU does for the plane.

Bump, crunch, grind, bump, crunch grind... Those were the sounds the plane was making while they fired up the engines.  I seriously thought I was going to die!  Then, once the engines got fired up, the plane was making a wierd clicking sound as we taxied on the runway, and even as we were taking off.  This really made me nervous.  Everyone was joking that the clicking was the sound of them manually winding the crank up so the plane could take off.  

I gotta give props to the pilot, he made up for the delays and got us into Phoenix on time, but the flight crew was just eh, not too friendly, they all kinda looked like they hated their jobs.  Everything costs money on this airline, it's $2 bucks for water or a soda, $7 bucks for a beer or a cocktail.  $5 if you want an aisle or window seat, or else they smack you in the middle seat.  By the way, that ""choice seat"" fee is per connection, so if you want an aisle seat on all of your flights (say you have 3 connections) that's $15, not $5.  Then I paid $15 to check my bag.  So, all total, my $330 round trip to fly 650 miles ended up costing me $380, but that's not all!  If you act now, you'll also have your return flight to San Diego cancelled in Phoenix!

Yes folks, they cancelled all flights out of Phoenix to San Diego at 9pm last night because there was fog at the airport in San Diego.  The worst part is that they made us wait for 2 hours before telling us our flight was cancelled.  I could have been half way to San Diego by car.  Then, everyone was asking if they can't just fly to Orange County or LAX (Which we heard from other people in the airport did not have any fog) and they abruptly told us no.  

So, what happens when your US Airways flight gets cancelled?  Nothing!  You get to sleep at the airport all night long, and then beg, pleed and pray that they can find you a flight out in the morning.  They don't put you up in a hotel, they merely offer you a ""discounted negotiated rate at a local hotel"".   They didn't offer to compensate.  They didn't communicate to us what would happen to our bags.    I heard from another guy who talked to the lady at the counter that they told him there were no flights available until tomorrow night, which means I would have been flying back to San Diego on New Years eve, assuming they didn't get fogged in.

So, what did I do?  I rented a car at Hertz, total cost was $127.50 (OUCH one way rentals are expensive) but I decided if I'm going to be driving to San Diego at 10pm at night I better have a comfy car, so I upgraded to the CTS for $20 more which was well worth it in the grand scheme of things, I made record time and was home in bed by 3am on 1 tank of gas (and people diss American cars but I'm here to tell ya, 300 horsepower, 1 tank of gas, 380 miles, AMAZING!)...  

Now I'm waiting to hear about my bags, desperate and afraid of how long it might take.  I'm also hoping they will refund me for my flight, but I doubt that's going to happen.  Will update the review after I see how they treat me after the fact.

Needless to say, I know flight cancellations in San Diego are rare, but I just don't think I can trust my life with this airline ever again with their old worn out planes, nickel and diming you to death with fees, and hey, wait a second, isn't gas lower then it's been in 10 years and yet the airlines are still charging us all these fees and higher fares?!"

I mean, I don't want to see anyone go out of business, especially in these tough economic times. Did the $2 I paid for my diet coke kill me? Heck no. Besides, they give you an entire can. I say yippee. Also, I've been flying long enough to know to bring my own snacks. There was no movie or other in-flight entertainment. But I was traveling with boyfriend Big Jim. That's entertainment enough. Our flights were on time, (actually, they were early). The planes were nice and clean and the flight attendants were very nice. Plenty of overhead space for our carry on luggage.  We also laughed when the watch dog gate attendant busted some chick for trying to cart on an extra bag.  Pretty funny.  I like US Air and I say thanks for a great flight to Phoenix!!"
2009-03-18,US Airways,Kw769huu2kXCyqJ-0DknMQ,1,"I fly quite regularly down to Phoenix (used to go direct to Tucson, but express jet went bankrupt) and I am stuck with US Airways as being the only non-stop from Spokane. With that being said I have never had an issue with them. But this last time really fried me and my traveling companion.

We showed up at the Phoenix Airport check-in counter 1 hour and 16 minutes before our flight was to leave. We had tried to E-check-in the night before but the system could not find our return reservation. 

For over 45, yes FOURTY-FIVE minutes we worked with a representative and then their supervisor do find our reservation. We had the original receipt with the confirmation code but they could not find either one of our tickets.

Low and behold at exactly 29 minutes before the flight was to leave the supervisor looked up and said ""well here is your reservation, but I can't issue you a ticket!"" 

""Why not""

""Because you got here too late, you must check in at least 30 minutes before your flight leaves and YOU (she did stress YOU) didn't do that.""

I am not kidding you. It took us another 10 minutes before she would issue us a boarding pass for the 830 PM flight (NOTE: It's 10 AM now a full 12 hours to wait). We made a mad dash for the plane zoomed through the security and showed up at our original flight, only to be told that the flight was closed and there was nothing they could do. So we waited and watched the plane sit at the gate for 23 minutes before it finally pushed back.

We went to customer service and were told again: ""It is our fault for not arriving early enough."" And ""You should expect computer glitches and get here earlier, it's not US Airways fault.""

They had the audacity to tell us that we should arrive at least 4, yes FOUR hours before a domestic flight with carry-on baggage only. Imagine if we were traveling international with checked baggage, should we be at the airport 24 hours in advance????

US Airways gave us no meal vouchers for their screw-up and while we waited and waited we watched two different times that the doors were re-opened on a closed flight for passengers that got there late.

They had no apologies, except to blame us for their computer error; they did nothing to help us out, meal vouchers, etc. They ignored our request for seats near the front of the plane; I was in the 2nd to the last row (22), while stand-by passengers for this flight received rows 7, 8 and 11. 

It will be a cold day in hell before I fly on this airline again, I will change planes, I will wait extra, I will do what it takes, but never again will I be told that THEIR computer problems are MY fault."
2009-03-18,US Airways,s_U_18tabVohP22c3gNgUg,1,"Ever taken a flight on a crusty dog turd? Neither have I, but I imagine it's not much unlike flying US Airways--the all time worst airline in every conceivable way.

How does an airline (that is already at the bottom of the barrel) get away with cutting back so ridiculously far on service while simultaneously  jacking up prices so ridiculously high on everything from water to luggage to aisle seats?!

Wow, great business plan, douchebags--take something that already sucks, make it worse and charge people more for it!  

Honestly, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the greedy crack smokers that run this airline started charging for toilet paper. By the square."
2009-03-22,US Airways,bD31es9nAgulbaobkiCE5w,1,"Trip: Seattle to Las Vegas (non stop)

Thank you so much for not knowing early enough that your plane's emergency lights weren't working. I really appreciated the initial 3 hour wait while some mystery part flew in from Phoenix.

Then I appreciated learning that the problem still wasn't fixed and the maintenance guys had to check the wires to see what was wrong.

And then having the flight (finally) canceled...... 9 hours after we arrived at the airport. Oh and there was the fun part about the number we were all given to call for rescheduling and the guy that told me it'd be a $150 fee because the flight wasn't canceled yet. So we waited another 1-2 hours in line to find out that it could be done for free. Maybe we could have actually scored some same-day tickets if that guy actually knew about the situation of the flight (as they said the people on the phone should)? 

It was nice to get it rescheduled and here ""Sorry"" about 20 times, but.... now I've lost 9 hours of my life sitting in an airport AND I'm missing out on a minimum of 24 hours of my Las Vegas vacation. Oh and tomorrow's earliest flight is also a layover so we'll also get to waste more time at the airport in Phoenix.

I also love the $26 we spent on parking (just to go back home at the end of the day) and however much we spent on the ever so 'wonderful and cheap' airport food while waiting on you to not fix the plane.

I really.... appreciate.... my experience with you, US Airways. 

(Insert many frustrated/upset/disappointed/angry words here)"
2009-03-26,US Airways,5OS2JuVtpsSKYQ78JvwIfA,2,"Since the 9-hour delay and then missing 24 hours of our time in Vegas.....

The flight went fine and they were all nice and all that.

The second ""fun part"" was when we got to the hotel and found out that the free show tickets that we were supposed to get were not in the account info. So I call up US Airways and, while the guy was nice and all that, he just said ""oh you must not have clicked yes for the tickets"" (which mom was quite sure she did) and said we should write a letter to customer service about that and the craziness with the first flight. 

Well... that's nice and I guess I understand when they can't fix something at this point, but shouldn't the fact that we don't get tickets been on our info? Like ""Yes to room, no to free tickets?"" or something. That would have been nice. I'm really not sure what writing to CS is going to do.

Anyway. The flight back was delayed (but only by about a half hour), they were able to handle some somewhat creepy turbulence due to high winds in Las Vegas (kids on the plane seemed to be having a blast), and over-all that was fine.

I'm just not happy with the delays in the beginning... and somewhat upset about the tickets. I guess I'll see what CS says (if anything)."
2009-03-28,US Airways,y54Xc9kph1oJ8FCwn_epmg,3,"Three stars you ask. I know, no one likes US Airways very much. And quite frankly on a day by day basis I waver from zero stars to five stars. 

Let me be upfront and honest: I am Gold Preferred on US Airways so I get lots of nice little perks. My dad is a pilot for another airline. I travel A LOT. My dealings with the air travel industry are different than most people and I think I have some insight into things than most people do. Just sayin'. 

First things first, the planes are old. I will acknowledge that but I have had the opportunity to fly on more of their newer Airbus planes in the last few months so I feel like they are making an effort to upgrade the planes. And in all honesty, I value my safety the most and I've never felt unsafe on a US Airways flight (couldn't say the same about some others). Coach is definitely horrible, but First Class is usually nice. My parents have flown Envoy Class to Europe and had a few bad experiences mixed with some stellar experiences. 

Crew is generally okay. Again, my experiences have been pretty middle of the road and average. I have of course, had some horrible flight attendants and have had some awesome flight attendants. 

US Airways recently was named first in on time arrivals out of 6 major airlines. I can't disagree with the statistics but then again they didn't factor in airlines like Southwest, jetblue, etc. so I think it's skewed. I seem to get to my destinations usually 10-15 minutes after my scheduled arrival which is annoying but whatever. I'm""m there and I'm alive. 

As for cost, I'm consistently finding them the cheapest alternative when I fly. Like I said, I fly a lot (I'm on the road 3-5 days a week) which has been surprising to me. I used to fly Southwest consistently as they were the cheapest, but times have changed. 

As for delays and cancellations, most of them have been related to maintenance or weather. And you know what, I'm not getting upset over that. I want to fly on a safe aircraft with pilots who think they can safely land and if that means a delay, so be it. Sure it's inconvenient in the short term but if I live, I'm okay with it. 

Here is my biggest warning to those flying US Airways: if you fly international double and triple check your flights every day the week before. Seriously. We booked a flight from Phoenix to Philadelphia to Madrid to Barcelona a year ago. A week before we are scheduled to leave, I check the flights and all is good. 3 days before, still good. 2 days before and I realized our departure has us ending in Madrid. No way to get us to Barcelona. WHAT? I called them up and they told us that the Madrid to Barcelona was actually a Spanair flight. Spanair had cancelled that flight, and not appropriately updated US Airways. Bullshit. The reservation had shown up as changed online through the US Airways website. They said they didn't think they could get us to Barcelona on the day we needed to arrive. I persisted and they got us onto a direct flight to Barcelona from Philadelphia. Definitely not the stress I wanted to deal with several days before vacation, and they were honestly less than helpful."
2009-04-03,US Airways,TOBPdPxC8G6d7aVKRrXw6A,2,"For my last to international flights I have flown US Airways. SFO to Paris, co complaints. SFO to Cabo via Phx...an absolute mess! First our reservation got screwed up. A great counter manager Miguel helped us get on the flight but it was all downhill form there. Our connecting flight had break issues we felt while taxiing, and on the return, such bad wind storms prevented us from leaving for 2 hours. Supposed 6 hour journeys turned into 8 to 10 hours. Everything was not the airlines fault (wing weather) but man, I've never experienced anything worse when traveling."
2009-05-19,US Airways,mgIZ4td2cHFmtSKBCDSKzA,2,"Hmmm..... US Airways looks like a scheduled airline with and extensive international and national route map. However, they definitely behave like a budget airline - $15 to check in a bag? Bad airline!

The flight was reasonable and the captain did do his best to make up a slight delay at departure. Definitely up to the standards of Jetblue"
2009-07-12,US Airways,VU4DpblvrY9khPS6pLM6fQ,3,"US Airways is kind of ghetto overall. Whilst Jet Blue gives you leather seats, I got pleather here; my legs were sticking and were so sticky by the end of my flights (eww). 

It's no-frills, of course, and follows with the trend that they'll nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING - $15 for the first bag, $25 for the second, and $100 for any more, plus $50 for each overweight bag. Soft drinks were complimentary on this flight, although I gather they didn't used to be (probably because they were ranked lowest for customer service - pay the same as everyone else for less). 

Why 3 stars then? It's the first flight (with connection - St. Louis - Phoenix - San Francisco) in a long time that made it on time. The pilot during the St. Louis to Phoenix leg also seemed in tune to notifying passengers of impending turbulence (good for a nervous flyer like me), and indeed, mild turbulence was mild, and there was more moderate turbulence during our ascent through a rainstorm. 

Note: US Airways was preparing to raise baggage fees during in-person check-ins to $20 and $30 for the 1st and 2nd bag, respectively. Total rip. But they're keeping the $15 and $20 prices for people who check in bags online first (which screws anyone who doesn't get their US Airways tickets directly from their site)."
2009-07-31,US Airways,1mP3ZveRinN8oTV0go0SNw,2,"the great thing about us airways is there is always something to talk about. the talk coming from my mouth is rarely good. i've flown with ""us"" waaay too often. i can count more times that my flight was delayed and/or canceled, my luggage has been lost (not delayed or mis-routed; straight up LOST) than times where the experience went even marginally smooth. the myriad of unacceptable situations i have encountered with ""us"" might boggle your mind. 

but, i keep coming back. 

maybe it is the free soda or the fact that i was recently sent a survey asking about what brands i might prefer with regard to the warm $7 beer on board? maybe it is because i get to pay them to check the bag they loose? maybe because the aircraft interiors are so awesomely outdated, inconvenient and uncomfortable? there are so many more options too!

to be very honest, i think ""us"" deserves 0 stars, but in generous recognition of the fact that i keep coming back i'll begrudgingly award 2 stars. after all, they haven't killed me and i've never been injured on a flight ... wait, actually i did suffer a minor injury once. but still, no death, near death or dismemberment experiences does rank pretty high when it comes to my air travel expectations. 

so there you have it: 2 stars."
2009-07-31,US Airways,x_6ys9geUOcqO6juCWIU9g,1,"Every great airline they've absorbed (America West, Piedmont, republic, Empire), they've turn to crap. I truly hate traveling with them and only use them when Southwest does not have a good time or flights to destinations. Pay for checked bags ($20 for first bag), meals ($7 for bistro meal), and most insulting for pillow and blanket ($7). Southwest still gives you a break on the bags and pillows, and at least gives you peanuts or pretzels. I've flown over a million miles in my career. Could care less if I fly one more mile, especially on Useless Air."

Get this: the reading lights above my seat would not go out. On a 9 hour red-eye flight to Europe. They just wouldn't turn off. There were a few other seats with the same problem. So what did the stewardess do? She stuck a styrofoam cup over the light. ""THERE.""

Never again."
2009-09-25,US Airways,n3y-MC387lOjpSPuBMabyw,3,"I would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids. This is a no frills airline. Nothing special.

Go Delta, if you have kids."
2009-09-29,US Airways,mxs6S8GghT53AmJTEQMrcA,1,"I redeem award miles for airline trips a couple times a year with various USA airlines.  Today I learned about of some USAirways charges that are way beyond what any other USA flag carrier imposes. 

A month ago I booked a Dividend Rewards mile redemption flight for a friend on Virgin Atlantic from London Heathrow to Boston Logan.  Today, I requested different flight dates, from March 3/9 to Feb 21/28, keeping the exact same itinerary.  Then, I am told that there is a $250 charge for this!  According to USAirways site (since checked), it doesn't matter that the flight is on a partner airline.  That is what they charge for ANY transatlantic flight change!

I have never experienced anything like this. For example, AA charges $0 for this type minor change.  I know and expect stricter rules and fees but this seems off-the-chart and much worse than USAirways' competition.  So much so, I hadn't bothered to check this prior to booking.  

For a couple of years I was a preferred status flyer with these folks.  That will never reoccur."
2009-10-09,US Airways,XiDDOZAkB4LLWLRmS07qzw,1,"Oh, US Airways.... You were my first. January 25, 1986, I flew on my first jet from Indianapolis to Washington International Airport, and you were in charge. Okay, your name was US Air at the time, but you're still the same airline... or are you? 

This year I have noticed a funny thing. The only doors that seem to shut on time are the ones that are on oversold aircraft. That seems awfully convenient for you. For that, I have nothing but hate. 

Three times this year I've watched a boarding door shut as I jogged up to a US Airways gate. Coincidentally, all three times your ticker at the gate has said: THIS FLIGHT IS FULL!!! 

Good to know you could overbook the flight, then benefit from a schedule deviation. Those of us who got screwed spend an additional three or four hours in the airport, while you get all the revenue from the oversold flight, with no penalty for screwing the rest of us by putting us on the ""shockingly"" underbooked flight that gets me home in the middle of the night. 

If my outbound flights are ever undersold, you always wait for me. You know what that means? Yep, you do. And I HATE you for it. 

To make matters worse? Tonight I heard two separate customer service reps for US Airways talk shit about passengers well within my earshot. Explain how I can hear that and not blame a lousy corporate culture. 

You know, 1986 was pretty nice, but US Airways has managed to suck a little more every year since then. I wish I never had to fly through Charlotte or Philly again.  You're the first airline I ever flew, and you're also the first airline I've ever actually hated.... with the fire of a thousand suns."
2009-10-17,US Airways,KoOmSiC709XiPAcG3Oia8w,1,This is one of the worst airlines I've flown with.  I've travelled the world on many different airlines.  Almost all airlines allow people to standby for an earlier return flight without charge.  US Airways will not.  They make you pay for any flight changes.  They'll rather let their planes fly out half empty than to accommodate their passengers.
2009-10-24,US Airways,0yBEzwL6OWsFm9arpjuFxw,2,"This airline is definitely no-frills, as other reviewers have stated. No TV, attendants didn't smile, nickel-and-dime everything -- wot, no peanuts or pretzels or crackers? Not even one lil' bag? Are you kidding me? You have to buy their snack bag to get those. That used to be one of flying's great joys. A tiny bag of salty goodness. Not on this airline! 

We've flown them before, but don't recall them EVER being this tight-assed. We've learned not to check luggage if we can at all help it because they charge $15 per bag. That's insane, but we know that's how they are, so we made do with carry-ons. Of course, that means the overhead bins fill up really fast and makes the cranky attendants even crankier. Whaddaya expect, lady, ordinarily most of this stuff would be checked! The employees seemed rather unhappy all-around. 

However, the flights themselves were basically decent. On time. It's worth it to us to put up with the lack of luxury when it's a really short flight and my Amex points are covering most of it. But for a longer flight, or if we have to come out of pocket more money, we'd look for a more comfortable airline."
2009-12-31,US Airways,WJR_pOP1QFzIbT9i2eEHaQ,3,"Nothing's of much grandeur in the aviation industry anymore. Anyone who doesn't purchase a first class seat might as well expect abysmal service, why let yourself be surprised? 

First of all, US Airways isn't ACTUALLY operating ""US Airways"" style. They're owned and operated by America West, which has always been notorious for nickeling and diming their passengers. Pre-merger, this used to be a somewhat respectable airline. However, as business progressed, America West has inflicted US Air and it's subsidies with ""America West Business"" - overcharging for everything but the seats. (But there's an exception to even that rule...) America West clearly had no idea of the sheer size of the combined new airline they had created. Flights have been continually late, cancelled, and overbooked. Planes are rapidly aging. On US Air Express Jets the America West logo is still quite intact. A lack of business has caused US Air to pull out of hundreds of gates, making airports ghost towns. So don't blame US Air, blame America West. 

Anyway...I've flown both America West & US Air a fair amount. US Air internationally isn't nearly as painful as a domestic flight. Since it's neck  and neck with Southwest, their standards have been mainly homogenized. Except US AIR CHARGES 60 DOLLARS TO CHECK TWO BAGS! Are you kidding me?! No wonder you're going out of business! Southwest cares about it's customers, even if it does pack them in like cattle. As soon as US Air takes the money out of your pocket, the service you paid for is up for grabs- there's no guarantee whether you'll get it or not. Though US Air does offer assigned seating and I do like that a lot. I can't say I'm fond of rushing to the plane to get the best possible seat. 

Flew US Air last night for the hundredth time. Had to fight myself to not buy Almonds...but at $3 they probably weren't worth it. Flight attendants were both friendly and positive. Definitely raised my morale throughout the flight. Flight was a few minutes early, so that was a plus. Things generally run pretty smoothly, at least out of Phoenix anyway. They're definitely doing something right out of Sky Harbor. So I'm not going to complain. It's an airline, they're all the same more or less. It usually gets you where you need to go, and you're not paying $400-$500 dollars like you would on Northwest or United. Take the good with the bad. If you absolutely can't stand lousy service and expensive fees, or you're just looking to get from A to B, there's always another airline to choose from."

He said I have to sort that out with them and I should go wait in the United line and figure it out with them and then come back to him.  I said that that would take 20 minutes x 2 waiting (again) in two lines, and asked if he could please just pick up the phone and call the United counter.  He refused and said he had people waiting.

1. Brusque, rude gate agents in Portland, OR yelling at me like I'm a child (right out of the gate, not in response to anything I did, they were yelling at everyone)

1.5. Did I mention that the gate agent lady was rude? She was being incredibly mean to even smiling, elderly people. Sure lady, we all have bad days, but you work in customer service. Get your shit together or find some job where you don't have to interface with people.  Wow. 

2. Making me pay $10 to choose a seat in advance so my massive 6' tall broad-shouldered frame doesn't get shoehorned into a middle seat by (see 1 and 1.5 above). Since when do you have to pay to select a seat when you're paying over $300 to fly same-coast?

3. $20 for the first checked bag, $25 for the second (unless you check in online, then you save $5 per bag). That's steep.

4. Same ticket price if not higher than other airlines except in this one strange situation where I booked just a week in advance and this happened to be the cheapest ticket.

I have had multiple incidences with Mesa/America Worst in the past... I flew 10-20 times per year on Mesa from Palm Springs to Phoenix/Reno for work. There were multiple flight delays, cancellations, delay luggage arrivals (over a day), and missed flights (my fault for not being at the counters 30 - 60 min prior to departure... when the counter closed down completely). I used to expect poor service all along because they are understaffed and under high stress. So it did not tick me off that easily.

I remember clearly that I had to go out of my way to reserve a standby flight with another airline while waiting to get my paper ticket/rebooking service after a flight delay and subsequently cancellation in Palm Springs. I managed to run through check point and on board before departure. I was hungry and exhausted after waiting for 6 hours at the airport... not counting the trouble with return trip (ticket was lost during the process) and 48-hour delay luggage (expected I guess).

The last draw was another delayed luggage for 48 hours via Reno. This time, the lost luggage center was much more shrewd. I was told there was a compensation per day. It turned out to be a pathetic credit to fly the Worst Airlines. I returned the voucher way before the expired date. They need it more than I for the next federal bailout.

The guy must have been pressing 70 and he was a card, yet professional and prompt.  The woman, maybe 55, was more business like, yet you really felt like she was the den mother of the flight.

I was entertained by these two as was the rest of the plane.  The guy gave a resounding welcome to Oakland that brought clapping from the economy section.

I applaud US Airways for testing the boundaries of the age limits to give us better customer service.  I was not greeted with rolling eyes or ""you are inconveniencing me"" stares in the isles!!!!

UPDATE:  9/3/20101 -- on my way back to Charlotte from Phoenix our plane was delayed five hours on a Friday night due to a diaper being stuffed down the toilet.  US Airways then hurried us back to the gate to check in only to find that the cabin temp was 100 degrees.  Hurry and wait.....hurry and wait.

2010-10-28,US Airways,NNl6gNzyBWHX2tGzVKBLTw,1,"Can I give negative stars? PLEASE? 

US Airways is probably the worst company internationally when it comes to customer service and retention. This past September I was supposed to leave Athens for SFO via PHI. When I arrive to the airport, I was informed (at the gate) that the flight was canceled -no prior notification. The cancelation was due to poor maintenance. While we were thoroughly disappointed, we did what we had to in order to get rebooked. The earliest departure they had for us was at 6 AM the next day. When we arrived at the airport (at 4 am) the next day, we were informed that our subsequent flight was ALSO canceled. Again, we began the processes of jumping through hoops, waiting on the phone and in lines to get on a decent flight. When the US Airways representatives told us that the earliest we can be home was almost three days after our initial flight, we demanded that they look into business and first class to get us home in a timely fashion. The representatives tried to book us, but were unable. At which point they directed us to look for flights on our own and then expect reimbursement from US Airways customer relations. Running from counter to counter, WE found two business class seats that would get us home the same day. We called US Airways back and asked them to book us on this flight. The representative was taking over 30 minutes trying to book us (time is precious in situations where 300 other people are also trying to get seats by the minute). Because the representative was unable to book us, he again instructed us to book our flight and then to get reimbursed from customer relations. Almost $10,000 later, we got home a day and a half late, but home none the less.
Now back in the US, guess what, US Airways claims that this is not in their policy and the most we can get is $700 in vouchers for, ready for this, US AIRWAYS! LIKE I would WANT to fly on this forsaken airline EVER again! I'm young and could be a potential LIFE customer to them spending tens of thousands of dollars. NO WAY JOSE! To make matters worse, they will not disclose whether or not they actually took the time to speak with the representatives who made the claims that we can get reimbursed. AND their online customer contract states that in case of canceled flights due to mechanical problems, it is THEIR responsibility to rebook the customer within a reasonable time frame. THREE DAYS LATER IS NOT REASONABLE! 
US AIRWAYS, you are THE ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!! I will not settle till you give me my money back, you scoundrels!"
2010-10-28,US Airways,anGFfnjQauiY1Nv80vTFog,1,"Like an evil health insurance company, U.S. Airways is always looking for new ways to rob its customers with fees. I'll never forget how U.S. Airways refused to give me a cup of potable water on a flight when I had bronchitis because I didn't have cash to buy a bottle. This airline is America's worst!"
2010-10-31,US Airways,JKqvv7wBNM5wfiRVxXDNPg,3,"I fly US Airways almost always for business travel, as they are our preferred travel partner and one of only three airline options for getting me from my office to our home office.  I must say that US Airways is growing on me, despite my early hatred.

I really think that US Airways is improving.  Sure, the fleet could still use a good tune up (I've had more than my fair share of mis-functioning lights/TVs/seats that wouldn't recline over the past few years).  But the people seem to be more friendly than they used to be.  Pilots & flight attendants with a sense of humor!  Gate attendants that don't snap at you for no reason!  Have I had some bad experiences flying with US Airways?  Of course.  No company has a 100% perfect staff, but the good has definitely outweighed the bad in the last 18 months.  And even with the extra baggage fees, it's still always cheaper for me to fly US Airways out of my local airport than to drive the 90 minutes to an airport that has Southwest by the time I submit my reimbursement for the drive.

The Charlotte hub, however, is always a much better experience than the Philly hub.  I think it must be that good ole Southern charm :)"
2010-11-01,US Airways,g5IgDSBNjJ6h-2XUUMo9bg,1,"Definitely sucks

Booked a 3 segment flight.  First and last segment refundable.  Middle segment non-refundable.  Paid extra.

They told me I couldn't make changes to my tickets because one of the segments was non-refundable and the most restrictive fare rules apply to the entire trip.  Wow.  So what was the benefit of paying extra for the other two segments?  Nothing.

Then.  I guess to make up for it.  I was told I could cancel the segments I didn't want to use (2, I was going to rebook on Southwest) and keep the fare in an account for reuse - plus a $150 change fee of course.  Well it turns out I can only use that money to fly the EXACT SAME ROUTE ... not for a different trip on US Airways.  Fail.  

They can keep the money.  Consider it the cost of the lesson I learned which is that I will save much more time and money than what I had lost by never flying US Airways again."
2010-11-09,US Airways,tcnDwvAmaH6A01TSm2Y7Ag,2,"well when you review airlines unless they are AMAZING, it is hard because we are conditioned to except SO LITTLE from them - even in 1st Class these days...  I got used to US Airways when I lived in Charlotte because it was their hub city, but this time I chose it because it was the same price as Southwest except I could pick my seat ahead of time.

What can I say, it is about what you expect. They charge for any checked bags and I think the 2nd one is crazy $$$ - I wasn't checking anything this time, but i remember that.

There really isn't anything stellar about this airline.. so basically if they have the right fare on the right dates and it's better than one of the others..  you won't be horrified or over joyed if you choose US Airways...

now i guess for 2 seconds I was spoiled by SONG for the minute they were in business.. they had the safety info recorded with funny accents - the flight attendants were all fun and wearing neon and each seat had tv and games etc...  Jet Blue is a little like that, but Song was so cute and fun.. made commuter travel bearable..."
2010-11-11,US Airways,ixnIdI4y782LtyuoDZIQMQ,1,"There's a reason we are told to be at the airport two hours in advance.  Had I left earlier, I wouldn't  have missed my flight at 7:30pm the Friday before labor day. 
The US Air representative was kind enough to rebook me on the next flight out.  Unfortunately the next flight wasn't until 6 am the next morning.   Since it was Labor Day weekend; the check in line was long. I decided to grab a quick bite to eat then come back.   I returned less than 15 minutes later and gone were the customer service representatives,  and  self service check in counters had closed. 
I thought maybe they took a lunch break or something.  So I waited,  waited, and waited some more.  There were several other US Air passengers there also. I  also checked Us Air's , but no one was there either. 
 I called the customer service line, and was transferred to US AIR's Hartsfield Jackson  number.  Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe how one feels when the customer service number rings the check in counter you're standing in front of.  Anyway I spoke with the same customer service 4 different times before she  told me US Air's reps would not return until 3:30am . 
There is absolutely no excuse that I had to call customer service FOUR times before getting a straight answer.   Someone should have been able to assist me by my second call. That's not an unreasonable expectation, is it? 
Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson is nation's busiest airport. As such someone should be on call especially on holiday weekends where increased travel should be anticipated.  Delta and Air Tran both had customer service representatives on call."
2010-12-01,US Airways,_0xG3O8voMyhl6zWMthBvg,5,"A definite must if you travel alot using US Airways. The lounge is a great place to get away from the madness in the waiting areas, and also have some privacy to concentrate on important matters. If you're in Phoenix,AZ, there are 3 club lounges which makes it even way more convinient."

Avoid at all costs."
2010-12-13,US Airways,aTFGLkEPU4UPhP-PTY7WbQ,1,"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  

Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  

You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.

  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops."
2010-12-14,US Airways,4UVIvgxfLEw9A9Wm2KUGaQ,3,"While recently I have found myself utilizing one of their competitors more and more since bags fly free and they offer less expensive, more convenient flights and their rewards occur more quickly. When booking my recent international package I was booked on US Airways. It's been a while since I have flown with this carrier. 
The accommodations on the flight between PHX and PHL were more comfortable (ie the seats were wider and more leg room) than the seats for the trip overseas. My same carry-on that fit under the seat on my domestic flight did not fit under the international flight. And the seat was noticeably more narrow. I also wish that the 4ish hour flight between PHX and PHL had offered a TV/Movies. 
I did find their staff to be quite friendly and the international flight service was better than expected. They regularly offered water and or juice and the movie selection was entertaining enough. Just wish they would clean the lavatories more frequently as they get a little cruddy by the middle of the flight."
2010-12-17,US Airways,ZiaDVsbb7Sani4_WGF_HUQ,2,"I doubt that I would have written a Yelp review if I had an exemplary experience.  I admit the only reason that I'm writing this particular review is to publically voice an individualized grievance.   I understand that the circumstances that lead to this particular complaint rarely occur.  I recognize I've been satisfied with US Airways before but one negative experience nevertheless tarnishes all previous perceptions.  Also, I'm hoping that somebody from the corporate office will read this review and provide me an incentive to purchase another US Airways ticket.  After all, I feel jilted for losing 3 hours and being inflicted with unnecessary hardships by particular US Airways employees.  

First, the tardy pilot who was either stuck in a non-existent traffic (nobody was up at 6:00 AM and the roads were emptied on the possibility of snow) or overslept.  Passengers were disgruntled enough to ponder whether the pilot was hung-over.  The problem began when the airline boarded the plane without the second pilot.  We were delayed 40 minutes and promised that we'd still arrive on time to make our connections.  Don't lie.  

Second, the person or persons who decided against installing in-flight entertainment on the A-319s.  The flight from DCA to PHX is a 5  1/2 hours.  If I had flown on American Airlines, I would've enjoyed an entire movie and several episodes of the Office, 30 Rock, and Community.  Even JetBlue offers free television on its short flights.  It's time to get with the times.  After all, there's only so much sleep that I can manage aboard a noisy airplane.

Third, the non-existent customer service representative that the flight crew promised us would be waiting at the gate but wasn't.  He or she was not available to help us with missed connections.  Half the plane was looking for connecting flights and the previously-stated delay resulted in everybody being bumped from their second flight.  At the very least, we'd like to know that somebody was there to help us immediately (e.g. notify us that plane had already left so we wouldn't needlessly run across the terminal for a non-existent plane).  Again, don't lie to us.

The silver lining of this ordeal was that we luckily scored two coveted standy-by seats on the subsequent flight to Portland.  But the fact that ""all's well that ends well"" is not a risk I'd want to take with in the future.  [Last Experience: December 17, 2010]"

2011-01-04,US Airways,wzYFDHXEox4p90hJn79L4g,3,"I can't complain too much about US Airways. They are a hometown airline, but I have been on a few that seem to be held together with duct tape.  On a trip to Europe a few years ago the bathroom was held together with the stuff.  How can that pass any reasonable inspection?  Scary to think what else was patched together for an Atlantic crossing.  They must have gotten rid of that plane because all other flights had newer planes.  

Most of the time their service is good, but they do need to step it up and clean the planes better.  The food is better theses days, but I normally fly other airlines."
2011-01-11,US Airways,NNzIpy0E18TQfmLFj1ko3Q,2,"I kind of have a love hate relationship with US Airways. I have always found their staff to be extremely kind and helpful. I especially appreciate how patient they have been with me the many times I have found myself running late, or without a seat assignment. That along with the great prices I have gotten on my tickets give them 2 stars. 

Now here is where my strong dislike for them comes in- almost every flight I have been on, I've been bumped. They do give me a voucher to put towards a flight in the future but it doesn't fully make up for the 5 extra hours you have to spend in the airport or missing your birthday dinner you had planned at your final destination. The cleanliness of the plane is questionable. Many times I have gotten to my seat to find trash. I don't know about you but I strongly dislike having to pick up after the person who was in my seat previously. Then, the over all care for the interior is lacking. So often I have found myself on a seat that was torn or the seat wouldn't recline. 

I guess for me with flying its the little things that make a difference. It's already uncomfortable flying, the last thing I want to do is sit somewhere that adds to the discomfort of flying through the air."
2011-01-11,US Airways,xijjvSP-WB06l22X6F4_Zg,4,"After spending a ridiculous amount of time on the phone today with US Airways, they get an extra star.  Why, you ask?  Quite simply, because they were nice and overtly helpful when they didn't need to be.

Due to ice where I was headed to, snow headed to where I am, and a combination of snow and ice in every connecting city that would get me there.  I expected to spend hours on the phone, waiting for someone to answer.  However, my longest ""expected wait time"" was 18 minutes, which actually ended up being 12.  A few times I had no wait at all.  Despite what must have been a hellish day in their call center, everyone I spoke to was pleasant.  Though I'm sure that being nice to them didn't hurt matters, I was genuinely impressed by how quickly my need to reschedule was solved.  Heck, they even asked me about seat preferences instead of just throwing me in the back corner near the restroom.

Now, some of this happy treatment may be because I know have Silver Preferred status after a crazy 2010 of travel.  But, honestly, I had a similar problem last year before I was even close to preferred status, and I was treated just as well.

After five rescheduling calls today, I'm hoping that tomorrow will find me on a plane.  And, if not, I'll be back on the phone.  Hopefully to another friendly US Airways call center person."
2011-01-16,US Airways,9fxrRmuvwM2vYaQ6oOjqKQ,4,"Okay i'm not going to lie the very first time I booked a flight with US Airways I was abit nervous and  not to sure why. Since then I pretty much enjoy them for my travel needs.

The first time I used them I was impressed. First their staff at the airport were very friendly but even better when I finally got on the plane I loved it. I loved it because the seats seemed a little bigger than most planes and it seems like it was almost a bench seat. Second they had little TV's that came down and you could watch. The most impressive thing to me is that our flight was suppose to take 2 hours and 25 minutes to Las Vegas and we got there in exactly 1 hour and 36 minutes. I have to add we did have a medical emergency on that flight but it just goes and shows ya it can happen.
I enjoy US Airways but dont fly them to often only because their flights are a little more expensive than other carriers but if you find a good deal I recommend flying with them."

I guess I always go through this with airlines.
I like the prices, so I accept all the shittiness that comes along with not paying an arm and a leg.
First, I HATE paying for luggage fees.
I mean it's bad enough that you're flying in the first place.
I usually tend to not eat at LEAST a day before flying, sometimes rather than checking in my bags, I'm nervous as all hell and checking my food up in the airport restroom. 
No good.
I just think it's an unfair way to FORCE people into paying more money.
Before I bought my ticket, I looked on the website to see if they charged for flights to Costa Rica, it said international flights were free except for, Europe, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.
Cool. 
I wasn't going to any of those places.
I decided to send an email to their customer service just to be on the safe side, ""We consider Costa Rica to be 'The Caribbean' so you will have to pay an additional fee.""
How the hell can you change geography to charge extra?
Fine.
So the staff at the US Airways in SFO was nice, pretty helpful, and patient.
Phoenix, was a bit of a different story, a BIG bit.
I guess the main thing that upset me was that they almost made me miss my flight. They knew in SFO that I was flying international, they could see I had a one-way. I was coming to Costa Rica to study, after my completion I didn't know what would happen, my school assists with job placements in countries all over the world and for different lengths of time. How COULD I know when I would return. I guess the woman checking Passports and itineraries didn't believe that I planned on ever returning to the U.S. so when I explained my situation to her she gave me this response, ""That's fine, but we don't want to get fined $5,000 for you not having a return flight.""
Stupid bitch, you guys make WAY MORE than that EVERYDAY on baggage fees alone!
The only person who was kind to me was a man that offered to help me look for a return flight which they charged $1,221.58 for. And an additional $45 for the booking service fee. WTF? Isn't it YOUR JOB to book flights with your airline? I guess I could have done it myself if the Wi-Fi in the terminal ACTUALLY WORKED!!! 
And to top it all off, once I got to Costa Rica and called about my refund for my return flight, the bitch on the phone gave me shit for going through Expedia. Then proclaimed, ""It's not OUR fault you didn't check to see if you needed a return flight.""
Even after I explained my situation.
Oh, and they are making me wait 7-10 business days (so really like TWO WEEKS) for my refund, when it only took them seconds to take my money.
At school I spoke to other students about what I went through, all of whom are WHITE (and I do hate to play the race card, but COME ON!!) and NONE of them were asked for a return flight.
So there you go.

First connection from San Juan into Philadelphia was on time. Finding a flight attendant was confusing since their outfits look like regular passenger wear. Blue polar fleece and regular striped shirts for the guys. The flight attendants were friendly enough. No Wi-Fi, no snacks. One passenger asked for some pretzels and the flight attendant laughed and said we haven't done that for years. I'm thinking same goes for cleaning the plane. Kind of grubby.

Second connection from Philly to MSP was alright. The flight attendants were very friendly and outgoing. A solid 5 for them. Plane again was just kind of grubby looking. 

Overhead compartments were full so I had to check my carry on. No big deal.

As if to illustrate how poor US Airways is now; upon my return home from Kawaii, I had to jump a short. 2-hour AA flight to Chicago.  Also in First Class.

We've been stuck flying with them because it's our only option, and it's always soul crushing. Arbitrary rules that force you in to hours long delays, stranded at airports, stuck in hotels overnight. Customers are cargo. It makes me wonder what they're shipping under the plane, there is so much absolute disregard for humanity on this airline."
2011-06-22,US Airways,YXayzjtiwFJkkN8akO-4FQ,1,"I don't know where to begin with this review.  I guess it started when US Airways stranded us until 2:15 AM in Honolulu with a 3 year old and no offer of support or compensation due to a flight member needing some more sleep time.  You know, we could have all used some more sleep time.  Unfortunately, we had to pay for an extra night of hotel, but US Airways did not think they had to reimburse us, despite the delay not being due to weather and was on their end.

So, they gave us each $100 voucher codes for a future flight - so we could apparently get the same bad service again.  What I received was worse.  An attempt 2 months later to follow their instructions by calling Reservations and trying to book us on a vacation flight to Phoenix became an act in futility when the call got dropped at least 4 times using 2 separate phones.  The last attempt got me the closest of making the reservation, but then the so-called customer service rep told me they were having trouble with their system and to call back in 5-10 minutes.  Excuse me?  I'll say you're having trouble with your system.  Why don't you call ME back when it's fixed???

The next day, I started over from scratch.  I wanted to use the vouchers for my wife and daughter, but I wanted to fly with them using Dividend Miles.  After a pain-stakingly long time with Richard on the phone, we finally get them squared away, but then he tells me I will have to call back to the Dividend Miles extenstion to make my reservation.  What?  Not even a ""let me transfer you over to the Dividend Miles"" folks???

So I play their game.  I call back and figure out which options to press to make a Dividend Miles reservation.  Guess who I get.  That's right, Richard.  

Hello again, hello.  

We go through another painstakingly long process of getting me booked, but at least he has my billing information so I don't have to repeat it.  We get almost to the end and I asked for our seating assignments to all be in row 19, seats D, E, and F for both flights.  Richard said ""no problem"".  Later that day, when I go to check our reservations, the outbound flight to Phoenix has us in row 19 as I asked, but the return flight still has us in Row 14.  So, I had to go into the system and change our seat assignments (thank goodness I could do that on-line and not have to make another stressful call).

Here is something even funnier: instead of two $100 vouchers if US Airways had given us the one night at the hotel, the cost would have been $215.  Yes, $15 more than what they ended up giving us.  $15 to keep a family of 3 satisfied instead of making us go through these painful processes and ticking us off and away from them forever.

I sincerely doubt anyone from US Air cares what I think, how I was treated through this entire process, or will read this.  But for those of you who have a choice in who you choose as your airline carrier, DO NOT CHOOSE U.S. SCARE!   Friends don't let friends fly US Airways.  They are not worth yours or anyone else's business.  America West was at one time a pretty good airline.  I flew with them a fair amount.  US Air has managed to sink that company to an all-time low by bringing in their practices on how an airline should be run, which is to say, ""F-you, just give us your money."""

We miss our connecting flight, the next two are overbooked, one was in 4 hours one was the next morning.  We waited 4 hours only to find out that the flight we were on standby for was delayed another hour.  When asking whether or they would pay for our hotel the response we received was that they ""might"" give us a discount coupon ""if"" we spoke to a supervisor.

I was travelling with my wife and my little dog who I had paid $100 to travel on the airline but was turned away from the Club which I had also paid for last year as a Dividend Miles member.   I find it distasteful that my liittle dog in an appropriate travel bag is excluded when loud, unsanitary children are allowed in the Club.  If they make me pay for a cabin pet, I would think those same pets should be allowed in the airport facilities. US  Airways makes it more and more difficult to fly every day"

2011-07-27,US Airways,U0z5Ggt-vS_VoGOAIwsPog,4,"I was terrified to get on my flight after reading so many horrible reviews. The night before I didn't sleep, shaking and crying I finally manned up and got on the 1 stop flight from Chicago to Phoenix with a connecting flight to L.A.

It wasn't the greatest experience I have ever had, but it was definitely better than expected. Here is why it might have sucked:

-The interior of the plane was aging (i.e. seats were worn out)
-No entertainment 
-No free food/snacks ( but we were offered juice/pop/water)
- Airbus 320 had less leg room than Airbus 321, and the latter also seemed more haggard

But the thing is....

The interior passed my expectations ( I was comfortable enough), I found my own entertainment ( magazines, books and my phone), food wasn't a problem because both my flights were under four hours, and the leg room problem was solved by a few visits to the washroom to stretch out my legs

I am giving US Airways 4 stars because they got me home safely, the staff was friendly, pilots were excellent and communicated with the flyers frequently which calmed my anxiety, both my flights were on time, I was happy I didn't have to pay 1,500 for an American Airline ticket and spent 400 instead and had an overall satisfactory experience!"
2011-08-12,US Airways,DG1KToX6G9Y2PdMmy96ecw,2,"As I arrived in Phoenix, Arizona on 8/6/11 from New York, I was not offered a meal while in flight.  The flight attendant was rude and dismissed me altogether...and traveling with a bad knee and paying for a ""Choice Seat"" was really not helpful when there is absolutely NO legroom and the seats are worn out and uncomfortable! For that, they get two stars...

As for the flight itself, I give it a golden ""5 Stars!""  There was no turbulence, it was a steady flight from beginning to end, and if there was going to be a small bit of turbulence, the pilot informed everyone over the loud speaker. Something that ""JetBlue"" should be doing...I feel like their pilots should also go back to re-train on learning how to fly without causing turbulence. 

So, if you're looking for great service and comfortable seating, this is NOT the airline; however, if you're looking for a comfortable no -turbulent flight, this is your airline!"

I have learned to expect 30-50 minutes on the tarmac upon arrival at PHX and give myself at least 50 minutes between flights to accommodate.

And after my recent experience with the airline's customer service, I mean it when I say I will do my best to avoid US Airways whenever I can.

My girlfriend and I had a 2:50pm flight to Minneapolis booked for Friday, September, 16th for a wedding.  On Sunday, September 11th, a friend of ours (who was going to be in the wedding in Minnesota) was killed in a hit-and-run.  The funeral ended up being Friday at 11:00am.  With all the fees associated with changing our flight US Airways wanted nearly $650.00 dollars to change our outbound tickets.  That's more than I paid for the round trip!  It's also way inflated compared to what they were asking for the one ticket to Minneapolis at the later time.  We asked if we could just skip our flight and book the later ticket.  The agents said we would lose our return ticket if we didn't pay a $150 reissuing fee.

They said they would waive the fees for people who could prove they were family.  The only way to do that was to get a copy of the death certificate, and happen to have the same last name as the deceased.  Even if I were family, how could you expect people to ask a mourning father for a copy of the death certificate because his son's horrific death was at a very inconvenient time?

I know many other airlines can be just as difficult, but I never knew one could go so far out of its way to make things so difficult for bereaved customers."

Since we were sitting in the back of the plane, all of the food was gone by the time they rolled their cart to us. Our lunch consisted of chips, almonds and cookies; these were basically our rations for 6 hours. Our first four choices of real food (ex: sandwich, salad, cheese/fruit, etc), were sold out. Plus, the flight attendants were less than friendly (to be fair, maybe it was just one in particular that was having a very bad day).

The top handle of my suitcase was partially ripped off and cannot be used. I took my luggage to the US Airways baggage desk and was greeted by an agent. I told him my luggage handle was ripped off and he came over glanced at it and said that there is nothing that he can do for it. He then proceeded to tell me that If I looked at the sign on the side of the door I would see that US Airways is not responsible for damages to the outside of luggage. He gave me a card with the website address to take care of it. He then also told that when I write this letter I should ""Give you all hell.""

They can completely fail to deliver due to their own problems, ruin your vacation and cause you to spend money without regard or refund. Can you imagine any other business where they can take your money in advance, then make you wait for hours before not telling you that they aren't going to deliver at all, then refuse to refund? It's an outrageous scam!
Our first problem was that their Flight 2834 did not arrive at Burbank from Phoenix to take us from Burbank to Phoenix to connect us with our flight 305 to Charlotte, which made it an emergency to book with Southwest to make the connection at a cost of $189.70 x 2 for the total of $379.40
Then they had another three hour delay for the same trip on the way home. They should be legally required to refund services not rendered at least. Then we had to suffer through arrogant and unhelpful customer service only to find out they would only give us credit for $25 in total for two passengers.
Think about the risks before opting for a slightly cheaper fair."
2011-11-14,US Airways,wBIPv_zKp81MzzqsX1ZWww,1,"I had a flight booked for me to go to training for a new job...When I learned that I would be flying US Airways I was not thrilled in the least. I've flown US Air a few times, some personal (including my honeymoon) and twice for business. 

For this trip I checked in online and had boarding passes sent to my phone. I don't check bags with US Air (more on this later), and I wanted nothing to do with their ""customer service staff"". With me I had a carry on suitcase and a garment bag. As I boarded the first flight, I asked if they could hang my garment bag for me. Every airline I've ever traveled on has a place in the front to hang a bag like this. Not US Air. The lady said ""are you in 1st class?"" I said no. ""Well if you're not in first class, we won't hang it for you. You'll need to put it under your seat because this is a full flight."" OK...No worries, as I love a wrinkly suit. Other than that there wasn't much notable about the flight. (Side note: if you have a smart phone, you should 100% do mobile tickets every time you fly...Life changing.)

Rewind a few years, to two really awful experiences. First, we flew US Airways to Jamaica from Portland, OR in August of 2008. This was the height of terrible fuel prices and a recession, and US Air wouldn't let you forget it. $30 per checked bag, and they were charging $2.00 for sodas on the plane. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SODA? I'm paying out the ass for a ticket and my bags, and you're going to charge me $2 for what should be a free Sprite? I went thirsty in silent protest of such horrible business practices.

In addition, a couple years ago I flew US Air on business and they lost my bag on the return flight. I returned late on a Friday night and didn't have my bag until Sunday...The service at the airport and over the phone was really atrocious. I know that lost baggage people have the worst jobs on earth, but there wasn't even a hint of compassion or ""hey sorry we messed up"". That's why I'll never check bags with them again, and also because I don't trust them to keep my belongings safe...

I will never, ever voluntarily fly US Air. I'll happily pay more just to avoid them. Do not recommend."

I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!"
2011-11-21,US Airways,2h-VxLrLDEdL9I5D0Tuepg,2,"I will never fly this airline again. US Airways cancelled my flight from Las Vegas to Houston with very little warning. I received a phone call at 3:00am and my flight was at 6:45am. When I called to inquire about this and to reschedule, I was told that my flight was cancelled for aircraft maintenance. Had I received more advanced notice, I would've adjusted my plans. The woman I spoke with over the telephone was completely unapologetic and offered no sympathy, she told me that I could get on a 5pm flight, or she could issue me a refund. As much as I would've loved to stay in LV, I had to get home that day, so I gritted my teeth and took the late flight. 

The man who assisted me when I checked in was more helpful, he arranged several standby flights for me and after one failed attempt, I was able to get on a flight bound for Phoenix around 12pm. I was supposed to connect to Houston from Phoenix, but he didn't apparently forgot to arrange this part for me.

The only part of my experience that was pleasant was the assistance I received in the US Airways Club in Phoenix. The woman at the front counter was able to get me a 4pm flight to Houston, and it was relatively painless on my end. She apologized profusely for my experience, and she was very efficient and courteous. Hats off to her, she takes US Airways from 1 to 2 stars. Of course, the flight ended up being delayed, and we didn't depart from Phoenix until 6pm. Aircraft maintenance again, apparently.

It's ridiculous how many of their flights are overbooked. On my way to Las Vegas, they were asking for volunteers step down and fly a different day because the flight was so full. I heard one of their staff members say that a flight from Vegas to LAX was overbooked by 15 people. 

Pick a different airline. Southwest, United, Continental...anything but US Airways. Even if you have to pay a little more. I lost almost an entire day, thanks to this airline, and we all know that time is money."

If you want to fly Star Alliance I would recommend Lufthansa  instead they treated me like a first class costumer even though I had a economy ticket! The one other thing is do not expect a modern aircraft or even a upgraded one when flying from Philadelphia to Frankfurt they only have the one screen in front of the cabin and they choose the movie you watch and that was the first time since I was 12 in 1989 that a plane only had that."

I understand it's an hour long flight, but even Southwest serves snacks and beverages on flights that long (and your first TWO bags are FREE).  Very unimpressive experience.  Boarding and stowing would be so much less an issue if you didn't charge for EVERY bag.  People might check theirs.  The only thing that got this two stars instead of one, was that we didn't fall out of the sky and I will hand it to the pilot on the return flight, as we flew through a gusty wind storm and though very choppy, he landed us very well."

So I did.  I was flying with them a lot for work, so I stopped using my company AMEX and began using my US Airways card for everything.  Then I got downsized.  And moved across country, while trying to sell my house in the worst market.

I've never not paid my bill, plus I stopped using it, but there was a bumpy patch where a few payments were a tad late.  I called and spoke with senior management, asking for a break.  Their response?

Something like: ""Bite Me.""  Followed with their bumping my interest rate to 30%.  Fast forward and I've almost paid it off and am now flying other airlines when possible.  Still, I do have to fly with them now and again.  And inevitably, during these flights, they annoyingly announce a deal to get their credit card and walk down the aisle, handing out applications.

Usually i don't compain about things and as a matter of fact i hate it when people do just for the sake of complaining or when they trying to get something free but in this case i truely believe that I would be doing US Airways a service by leaving you with these remarks in regards to todays flight.  About an hour and a half into todays flight It turns out that the seatbelt light happened to be on when I rang the bell for service.   The captain stated that we may be hitting some turbulence about 20 minutes earlier which is totally understandable.   I wanted to get a cup of coffee.  The attendant that came to the answer informed me that i am not supposed to ring the bell for the attendant when the seatbelt lights were on and because of that she is unable to get me that coffee.  The way that she portrayed this publically made me feel like i did something wrong.  I happily stated that i understand and would love a cup when the light goes off.  She then turned around without saying anything and went back to the front of the plane.  The guy next to me on the left questioned me saying that he wondered why the seatbelt light was still on due to the fact that we did not hit any turbulence and this was one of the most comfortable / non-turbulent flights that I have been on to Arizona.  I travel here 6-8 times a year.  I thought of this being strange as well but I decided to wait patiently.  I then later got up to go to the bathroom after seeing others go and the seatbelt light was still on.  When i arrived at the bathrooms it seemed to me that everything was pretty low key.  So low key that through the screen i could see the attendants relaxing which is completely fine with me.   Now i can totally understand a Captain giving his attendants some well deserved downtime with the seatbelt light on but this light was on for the whole duration of this smooth flight.   After I got back to my seat I realized shortly afterwords that the attendant was serving business class drinks and did nothing to get me what i had requested.  This made me feel pretty neglected due to the fact that i did nothing wrong and did not deserve to be treated in such a fashion.    This treatment made me feel like I was a nuisance to the crew.  At the end of the flight, the captiain had stated that we had some strange tail winds.  I maybe should attest these tailwinds to the reason why the seatbelt light was turned on but needless to say that this was one of the most comfortable flights i have been on due to the fact that my Fiance slept the whole flight without even waking up.      Now i am releasing no names because I do not want anybody to get punished by this or ruin anybodys Careers but at the same time I will be more reluctant to choose US Airways  for my next flights.  I hope in the future that US Airways will treat every passenger with the same respect in order to keep a happy returning customer base."

She arrived at Sky Harbour over 2 hours early, checked her bag at the kiosk and was told that there was no seat assignment available for her. For the next two hours I called their corp office (they said she didn't check-in, then that she checked-in at 6.50pm when she actually checked-in at 4.48pm then that the flight was extraordinarily overbooked for some strange reason) which was of no use and was told that they had no authority to override decisions made at the gate. I then frantically called Expedia and finally got ahold of someone there who stated that the ticket was confirmed and that they'd call the airline. Eight minutes until the flight left the gate, my daughter was called (there were 9 people on the waiting list, she was number 5) and she made the flight...solely through the efforts of Expedia and possibly my threats to fine a formal complaint with the FAA and the AZ Corp.

 I really had no problems with this airline, only that they charged me 25.00 extra to take my luggage. But most airlines do this now a days, I just wish everything was added to the original ticket. The plane was a little bit old , I could tell by the ashtrays on every seat and also the stewardesses, I think they came with the plane.
Besides that all the airlines are the same
Stewardess giving the safety instructions pointing at the emergency exits on every direction. I've heard it so many times my mind refuses to go trough it one more time. The song YMCA starts playing in my head while she does her hand  gestures  misspelling every word. Besides the chances of using the emergency exits in case of an emergency after takeoff are close to none. You make it or you don't.

But, with all that as your history lesson for the morning... here are my thoughts on the flight that left BWI and arrived in Phoenix TWO HOURS early. Now rather than be ""that guy"" like the dude that was on his cell complaining that he arrived early and would have to reschedule his rental car etc... I give you the following:


""The Good""
- Arrived safe and sound.
- TWO HOURS EARLY ARRIVAL... I do not know how it happened, I do not even want to know how it happened. But, I know it did. Thank you El Nino and La Nina for providing the winds to allow the plane to move a little bit faster.
- The flight attendants were polite and very attentive and also used common sense when they had the opportunity to wake me up when I was trying to grab some shut eye.


""The Meh""
- Just curious why there are no smoking lights on planes anymore... No where else to start the discussion so I figured here would be a good place.


""The Bad""
- The $25.00 additional bag fee.
- The fact that there the seats are not comfortable and they are looking for as many sardine impersonators they can fit into the plane.
- Zone boarding.... Why in God's name do the people that sit in the front board first and then the folks that are in the back need to wait until the goofballs clear the aisle?!? People and companies paid a lot of money for some consulting company to tell them that this is efficient... well a few things here. 1. It is not. and 2. Really?!?!"
2012-02-11,US Airways,rgup-I6CCexhDg0UaZxeFg,1,"My wife and I flew from upstate NY to San Juan PR for our cruise.  

Our flight from Albany NY left at 5:15am.  We are constantly bombarded with:  ""Get to the airport 90 minutes before departure!"".  We got there at exactly at 3:45am and....just a big line of people waiting.  Evidently US air doesn't open until 4am.  There were 3 US Air flights that morning, all before 5:30!  How about organization of US airways?  How about opening ON TIME!??!

Then we got to Philadelphia.  Checked the gate number on the big board.  Gate A21. Had to take a bus to a terminal A.  Checked the gate number on the big board again.  Gate A21.  As we are walking to our gate (15 minute walk), I hear something about a San Juan, US air gate change.  Check the gate number on the big board again.  Find out it's B33.  Which is a 20 minute walk in the other direction!

Get to B33 and it's a zoo.  Evidently other people magically got the memo that it's B33, not A21.  I'm in shape but I nearly ran for 30 minutes with heavy carryons and just made the initial boarding call.  Had I walked, i would've missed the flight.  How about US Airways giving connecting passengers some notice?!??!  I nearly missed this flight!

Then I hear some announcement about an aircraft change and the flight being overbooked and offering a $300 credit for your next flight with US airways.  And then moans and groans.  Then I can't hear the rest of the announcement.   Followed by passengers getting confused and angry (by their reactions).  

Then it's a game of ""Broken Telephone"" as the message spreads:  The new aircraft is smaller.  It was supposed to be 8 seats per row, now the new aircraft is only 6.  So whoever has ""G"" and ""H"" seats are BUMPED.  Frantically get our boarding passes out and it's ""A"" and ""B"".  If I had a G or H seat, I don't make my flight, I don't make my cruise.  The people next to us are furious.  They have G and H seats.  Felt really bad for them.  

Absolute chaos at gate B33 in PHL ensues!!!  (I should've taken video!).  People yelling and SCREAMING at US airways staff.  About 60 people just had their vacations ruined.

Positives were that they didn't call out zones:  just as long as you didn't have a G or H seat, you were golden.  And they didn't offer the credit card with 40,000 on the flight either.  I guess the pilots knew that everyone was a bit miffed because we were 30 minutes late coming out of the gate and magically got there in time.

Negatives about US airways (other than above):  No on-flight entertainment.  They had TV's because that's how they did the safety instructions.  But no TV, no movies.  I knew they had them because it started for a couple of seconds (30 Rock) but THEY SHUT THEM OFF!  No Satellite radio either!!!  THEY SHUT THEM OFF AFTER PULLING OUT OF THE GATE and NEVER TURNED THEM ON DURING FLIGHT!  We know that you want to charge us, but come on!

BTW, we got to San Juan and there were about 60 pissed off passengers there because the same thing was going on the return flight back to Philly.  

EPIC FAIL"
2012-02-20,US Airways,4Zvaie1cdB3uHNghr0A1Rg,2,"Two stars is two to many.  The worst customer service I have ever experienced.  My husband took a bump and they gave him a ""$600"" flight voucher.  Come to find out that the value of the voucher is not really $600 it is only good toward your next flight purchase ""up to $600"".  What a load of BS, we couldn't use the voucher for two tickets, we could not use the voucher with miles, we could not extend the term of the voucher.  They give these out in hopes that people don't use them I guess.  you have to call to book in order to use the voucher and in turn they charge you $25 for not booking online,  add that to the $25 bag fee, and the $45 seat upgrade if you want an isle or window..  middle seats are free, and what do you get??  A bunch of BS from an airline that obviously does not care one bit about the passengers and doesn't want returning clients.  The reps on the phone just pass you off to the next person and are RUDE!

THe flight was delayed so much that I missed my connecting flight in Phoenix.  The airline had delayed the Phoenix flight to DFW 15 minutes and they still had 20+ people miss their flight.  They are very unorganized and I will NEVER fly them again.  The agent ended up giving him highlighted piece of paper to call for a hotel since he missed the last flight of the day.  It was only for $30 off. He still had to pay $70 when you include tax for something he couldn't help!  I had a previous situation that happened similar to this one where my had to stay the night in a hotel.  Luckily, on that trip they did pay for the hotel, however, I was given meal vouchers (without a car) to a McDonald's on the other side of a busy interstate about 1 mile way.  I have never had any problems with any other airlines.  I have never even written a review before, but this was makes for a good first.  I had forgotten about my previous incident being that it happen a few weeks ago.  I don't think there is anything that could change my view about this airline.  Never again."

2012-03-19,US Airways,ENk7f9_B7nQePARdILclJA,1,"I fly a lot and have been on various airlines....but, someone please explain to me something that boggles my mind....

I bought a ticket...choose seats for my friend and me...Excited that I wouldn't have to sit next to a stranger for the long flight to Chicago. We were set for our trip.

After checking into my flight the seats that we chose was not what was on our boarding pass. NOT even close. Huh? Surely this is just a mistake. So, I politely talked to a boarding agent. She advised me ever so rudely that the seats I chose were just a ""request"" and they didn't have to honor them. WTF. Maybe I'm slow, I don't understand...From what I recall from any other airline (save Southwest) when you buy your ticket and pick your seat, that's the seat you get. I understand that there may be seating changes to accommodate for families but why have your customers choose seats in the first place if you are just going to jumble them all around anyway? Then to be told with such ambivalence that those are ""requested"" seats and that you should feel happy getting on a flight that the airline overbooked is tacky and ridiculous.... Then as some sort of consolation they said I could pay an additional $79 to sit in the emergency aisle, just so that the person I booked my flight with originally and picked adjacent seats can sit together....why would I give US Airways another dime to sit in an exit seat I know they will just fill up because they constantly overbook.

US Airways made me very cranky. Whatever savings you get with booking with them isn't worth the hassle and disappointment you'll get. I doubt I'll be flying with them, again."
2012-03-30,US Airways,YFA4HaJgjZkgB8_6zDG8lw,2,"The relationship that USAirways and I have is that of a love-hate relationship.  I continually bitch about their tardiness for flights, their crappy in-flight service, their stinginess with things, and on and on and on I can go about how they suck in my book.

The problem is they almost ALWAYS have the cheapest airfare for my travel needs... not always, but almost always.  As such, I'm a rewards member with them and I (dare I call it love??) really like their low prices.

I have flown tons of times via USAirways for my Cali travel as well as other regions of the state, so this review is based on ALL my experience with USAirways, not one single horrible or one single awesome experience - they've all averaged to a solid 2 stars.  Frankly, if you can handle not so great and below-average flight experience (not many people can, but I have pretty good will power for short-duration flights), this is a good cheap option."

I put up with the bad customer service, delayed flight times, horrible inflight service, and outdated planes just because of the cheap price of the airline ticket.

What sucks even more is I am a rewards member with them. I have enough to book a one-way flight but they do not allow you to book one way flights with your mileage points. You would have to be charged round-trip.  What's up with that! Once I have enough miles to book a round-trip flight I will do so and then hopefully never fly US Airways again.

I say only fly US Airways is if its the cheapest by far or a last resort."

However, my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation. We arrived to check in at sky harbor only to be told that it was too late to check in.  Our flight was for 5:49pm. It was 5:10pm.  We were told by our eye-fluttering attendant typing at the keyboard with a fake smile that we needed to arrive at least 45 minutes prior to departure.  We lost are already paid for seats.  Resisting the urge to grab him by the neck and bang his head on the counter to see what would fall out, I politely asked for options which he responded with two: 1) wait until 9:00 pm to fly standby 2) or depart the next morning at 8:30am.  Not wanting to wait fora hours to see if we could board an oversold flight, we chose the latter option. 

When we arrived in the morning to a chaotic crowd of passengers, there was little direction by us airways employees.  Instead they only contributed to the chaos by giving vague directions.  They wouldn't last five minutes in my classroom.  Clearly some employee training is overdue here. 

When we finally checked ourselves in, we faced gates changes, delays due to maintenance, and an ever increasing amount if disgruntled travelers surrounding us.  I'm glad it's over.  No more US Airways."

(Those Late July Organic Sea Salt Multigrain Chips & Zesty Tomato Salsa were bomb tho, lol).  Flying just ain't what it used to be....Overall it is easier to fly US Airways in terms of less busy terminals, easier check-ins and pick-up/drop offs.  I always arrive early or on-time.

So we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out, said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment, yet it was fine on the arrival.  So he had to pay.  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds, 1 pound over and gave them grief.  The lady freaked out and started taking out shoes and clothes and shoving it in carry ons.

I landed at my destination, picked up my bag at the baggage claim carousel and went straight to my hotel.  I was not able to check in right away and did not open my bag until I was in my room, 3 hours later.  I had a business meeting to get to and did not have time to return to the airport to file a claim with the Baggage Resolution Center. 
My bag had been searched by TSA and I had a plastic bag inside that was torn open from the bottom and the contents inside were missing.  I sent an email to US Airways to file the complaint but then noticed that the official policy stated I had to file this request in person.  I was already passed the 4 hour window and was not able to do this in person.
So when I returned to the airport 2 days later to fly out, I went to the US Airways counter and was told that this policy is strict and there are no exceptions.  This is outrageous!  How can this be their policy?  Other airlines do not have this ridiculously strict policy.  I'm going to fight this and see if I can have a more acceptable resolution. 
I will post a revised review if this get handled appropriately by US Airways."

2012-06-25,US Airways,IJN3oLrlXLRuFtH2jN_NWA,1,"If I could write a review sans stars, I would.

I had hoped that in a few years' time, US Airways should have had ample time to adjust to their negative feedback from a few years ago (the broad trend, not merely my own thoughts). Nope! And it almost seems as though they're proud of their poor reputation.

Also, should anyone raise the issue of low profit margins in the airline industry, perhaps we should look to Southwest as a case study? http://www.slate.com/articles/business/operations/2012/06/southwest_airlines_profitability_how_the_company_uses_operations_theory_to_fuel_its_success_.html

Back to this year's US Airways experience, it started when the boarding sign for my particular flight did not light up (though all others did), and I nearly missed my flight.

OK, that was just the prequel, the real story began when we landed in New England, and given it was raining, the flight attendant said the baggage handlers would load up our international travel size commuter suitcases (that were formerly under the plane) on a luggage cart, for us to collect - ideally covering the suitcases from the rain. As I exited, I noticed mine was the only one on the top (3rd shelf), next to the pilot's. Unfortunately, the top shelf was as tall as I am, I was wearing heels, and carrying a backpack (could have toppled forward, if not for backward). I requested help, and the gate agent said I was taller than her. So? I still can't lift my bag from that height, can she please get someone to help me? No luck. I insist on pointing to the baggage handlers, what about them? She igrnoes me 

The baggage liaison woman then demands I get off the tarmac. Sure! Naturally, I say, as soon as I get my bag, but I cannot reach it. This continues. I lose my cool. It escalates. Finally another woman comes over, and helps me with my bag. Meanwhile, the baggage handlers stare and do nothing. I attempted to report this to a ticket counter agent, waited for 15 minutes for a supervisor, then ran out of time.

If there were any other viable airline between the two destinations, I'd take them, hands down. Alas, no dice. I am stuck in an unhealthy frequent flyer relationship."

This coming from someone who travels constantly and practically lives on airplanes. HOWEVER...I was on a work trip to Phoenix and really, really needed a nonstop flight back. Enter: US Airways. Hesitantly.

Now, this experience solely reflects their A319 aircraft, which was clean and fairly comfortable like most Airbus planes. Also, like most Airbus planes, it was quiet. Generally, I prefer Airbus to Boeing from a comfort standpoint. But that's beside the point.

The crew is what really made me upset on my last several US Airways experiences. I felt like none of them deserved a job, and I was hell bent on making sure my money didn't help them keep theirs. Low and behold, the staff on US Airways were completely different in 2012 than they were in 2007. Friendly, helpful...just about as much as you could ask of a crew on a US-based airline in the 21st century!

I'm a high-up frequent flier on American, so most of my business will still go to them, but US Airways has now jumped above United and Delta as far as where I rank the ""Big 5"" airlines in this country."

It really chaps my hide that luggage is now $25 so I've made adjustments in my packing to fit everything I need into two carry-ons.  At least they make you aware of the fee though, what I did not know is that they now charge for meals on flights across the country.  For $8 I got the nastiest sandwich they could throw together.  They also make you recycle, which is really cool but I wanted to throw away my plastic drink cup, put my tray up and pass out but I had to wait 20 minutes because they weren't collecting plastic at that time.

Here's a tip US Airways, when you treat your customers like crap, it puts them in a bad mood.  It's not a good idea to put people in a bad mood when they're cramped in  a small area, surrounded by strangers and can't get out of their seat for 5 hours."

Recently, my wife and I flew from Phoenix to Munich via Los Angeles. The first leg was (unfortunately) on US Airways through the 'Star Alliance', which is a group of airlines that claim to work together to make the flying experience more enjoyable.  We were scheduled to connect to our Lufthansa for the flight to Germanyleg in Los Angeles. 

What we experienced was horrible customer service on US Airways, leaving me to question what is the benefitof the Star Alliance?

The details: The US Airways agent refused to check our bags from Phoenix to our final destination, even though they are in the Star Alliance with Lufthansa, which they claim makes it all one big happy family of airlines....    
When we asked why the US Airways agent wouldn't check our bags through, as we had all our boarding passes and were checked in for all our flights, he decided to (we find out later) lie and say that 5 days prior, US Airways changed its policies to no longer allow luggage to be checked to a final destination if you are connecting as part of your trip. It had never been this way, based on the benefits of the Star Alliance, and we make this trip every year, so were very put off by his lack of help.
 
The result - my wife had to sprint and catch a shuttle in the very busy Los Angeles airport to get to the international terminal, begging Lufthansa to wait for her sweating husband, who had to wait (and wait) to pick up our bags in baggage claim and bring them to the Lufthansa ticket counter to be rechecked for the long flight. Unfortunately, the US Airways flight left Phoenix 1  1/2 hours late, dwindling our connection time, concerning us that our bags would not make it on the flight to Munich.

Thankfully, the ticket agent at the Lufthansa counter was amazing, claiming it was not a problem to get our bags on the plane, even with such a short amount of time before takeoff, (he even had an additional agent waiting to take our bags if need be) but informed us that the US Airways ticket agent had told us wrong information.  He said the ""new regulation"" the US Airways agent referred to does not exist, especially since we had our boarding passes from Los Angeles to Munich already printed.  Basically the US Airways agent had lied to us and refused to help.

What matters here is that US Airways has a complete disregard for customer service, has no issue taking money for an expensive ticket, yet lacks any desire to deliver customer service or provide the services they claim they provide to their customers.
 
My wife and are were so frustrated and so put off by the lack of help to get us checked through to our final destination, that I had to share this story.  Don't believe everything you are told by these airlines, and DEMAND better service!    We will be looking for a different airline option next time we fly - choosing not to fly on US Airways based on this experience."
2012-08-21,US Airways,ZKzopdjbDIYn7GE3Aa8NWg,3,"I was worried to fly US Airways at the begging but it was alright. When i made a connection here from San Francisco i realized that this is the hub and headquarters for this airline i believe. 
My experience was not bad but not very great either, it's more on the bad side but I was okay with the service. It was like any other airline I've been to such as American and United. 
Just a side note, the PHX airport is HUGE and nice."
2012-08-28,US Airways,LZgvqbZIpTgdm64a7lOYBA,4,"I recently flew US Air Express through Phoenix and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable an experience it was!  Gate agents and flight attendants were exceedingly friendly and helpful, even offering to allow me to switch seats so that I had an empty seat next to me, which is a big plus when travelling with an infant.  
Of the four flight segments, two were on time and the other two were early!  As an experienced and frequent traveller, my priorities when travelling are in this order: 1. Safety; 2. Price; 3. Comfort.  While travelling with them, all of the planes were in good working order, spotlessly clean and surprisingly comfortable (as comfortable as a coach seat can be).  
They are a no-frills airline, which is fine by me.  I prefer to bring my own food and snacks, plus I can entertain myself with a book or iPad movie, no need for them to provide entertainment and raise the price of a ticket.  Oh and they provide complimentary non-alcoholic beverages, including my favorite Mr. Pibb/Pibb Extra.  They actuallly made two passes with beverage cart during my short flights.
I also had to contact their customer service department to make a change for my return trip and did not have any wait time, plus a pleasant and helpful person to accomodate my change.
Actually looking forward to flying with them again when the need arises.  Perhaps US Air is starting a new era of providing excellent customer service, while also having low fares.  Will keep an eye on them!"
2012-09-04,US Airways,R7Cz20u44kmZqAj9qqzpkA,5,"ALWAYS love my US Airways. Who can argue with the great first class service in first class and when you have had 3 jack and cokes and you ask the stewardess for another one and her question is, ""Are you driving?"" to which I very politely responded, ""No, Im flying!"" 

She lost it laughing and brought me another jack and coke. I tipped her $30 as I got off the plane for her sense of humor and keeping me happy. And no, I wasn't driving, my hubby picked me up at the airport. 

AWESOME FLIGHT!"
2012-09-04,US Airways,jPdG3RXX5nUpgGBFfGjy8g,2,"My expectations for airline travel are quite low. Here's my own personal passenger bill of rights:

I must make my connection when I have one.
I should never have to sit in a middle seat.
I should reach my destination no later than 2 hours after the promised arrival time.

US Airways consistently challenges those three requirements.  

Let's start with connections; the connections are quite compressed, like 30 minutes.  That is unreasonable and leaves no room for error.  If you miss the connecting flight then it is nearly impossible to get on the next flight because it is booked, in fact overbooked.  I have missed my connection multiple times due tight scheduling by US Airways.

As for the middle seat, let's just say that is pure torture to me.  US Airways charges you for an aisle or a window, even in economy.  Lame.  I am now trained to pay for exit row or the 'plus' sections on other carriers, but US Airways has taken this to a whole new level of stinginess and revenue generation.  Booh!

Usually if I am within 2 hours of my expected arrival time I can recover.  Whether it is catching up on rest, rescheduling a meeting, grabbing a late dinner, 2 hours seems to be a reasonable delay - I told you my expectations are low!  US Airways has only achieved a 50% success rate and that is an F in absolute terms and at best a D if you grade on the generous airline curve.

US Airways is definitely not my first choice."

I remember those twitching and wincing experience and then Ass relieve once I've got off my seat for arrival. What's was up with that?!? two centimeter cushion seats?

Nowadays I've used US Airways going to PHX for connecting flights, and it feels that there doing away those uncomfortable economy seats, well maybe a slight upgrade to half an inch of padding, but those rides have gotten better now.

The service is okay, some flight attendants smile, talk a lot, or just look tired of their job. They do have decent rates, but hey you get what you pay for and still serviceable."
2012-09-23,US Airways,LgRqSXTq9p73aZtu8VTb5A,1,"I've been in sales and customer service/client management for over thirty years and I can't think of the last time I've seen a more uncaring attitude than what I saw today.  One of our boarding passes misprinted and we had to reprint at the airport.  As I was reprinting it we had two couples walk past talking about the worst customer service ever, never flying US Airways again, rudest they've ever been treated, etc. 

We were at the gate over an hour early and I decided to check the score on the Niners' game at the bar.  While I was walking there I passed the US Airways Customer Service counter.  I went to the CSR and explained the situation and suggested that if someone talked to them to find out what the situation and suggest that they could probably rectify the situation. 

The response stunned me.  Her answer was that it's not worth doing because she's been in the industry nearly 30 years and some people are just never happy.  If she offered a free meal they'd be mad that it wasn't two.  If she offered a $5 food voucher they'd be mad that it wasn't $10 and that if they were that mad they'd come to her to talk about it. 

She finalized that it just isn't worth trying to make these passengers happy and that she's heard that people will never fly her airline again because next week if US Airways is the lowest price those people will be right back on US Airways. 

Nice job, Lady at the Customer Service counter who's name I'm really tempted to use here.  If you'd shown that you cared about the customer enough to even find out what the situation was you might have retained four customers.  As it is you just lost six."
2012-10-09,US Airways,NSdUKn9Zd8Uuwwo2JE23Yg,1,"Nothing is new here about my bad experience. But hopefully I can shed some light into their evil world. And then the travelers can choose wisely.

US Worst has retained its title for me in 2011.

Typical story. Mechanical failure. Flight was delayed in Palm Springs. I missed the connection in Phoenix. I was rescheduled for later flight. A delay of 4 hours.

I always avoid US Worst but sometimes it's just impossible. It helps when US Worst is part of Star Alliance (Wrong... more later). I was a United Premier member. I thought I still can get my benefit on US Worst. That's a wrong assumption.

I have experienced nightmares on more than 50% of US Worst flights. More so lately... 100% in past 2 years (2 flights). Luckily I've shifted all possible flights to other not so worst airlines.

To make a long tedious nightmare educational:
1) US Worst does not recognize the full status of United Premier. Not like United and Continental.

2) It's business as usual for US Worst. The costumer service rep expressed indifference. It reminds me of rental clerks in Las Vegas and FlorIda (""you don't like it? Too bad! Move aside, there's a long line waiting for our premiere service"") There is no apology. The mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qualify for any compensation.

So travelers, kowtow to the Almighty US Worst whom provides world class service to everyone. I wonder what service you will get in economy class."
2012-10-11,US Airways,tb6duyHx-XaUD5xvEbdY3w,4,I enjoy flying US Airways. Their seats are more comfortable than other airlines and the staff has always treated me right regardless of which airport I'm flying in/out of.

To our horror an easy one hour layover turned into 5 hours at Phoenix. The original flight seems to have magically disappeared if it ever existed at all. This would have been acceptable if they had let us know they were changing our flight. They sent us a confirmation email before the day of travel and never mentioned the change. There were 4 flights from Charlotte to Phoenix, we would have taken a later one had we known and not gotten up at 2am to get that first one only to be stuck in the busiest airport I have ever seen. 

The sinister, evil part in all this is the Sky Mall, I think they intentionally delay people in these airports so you will spend money in their Sky Mall. WHO SHOPS FOR SUITS IN THE AIRPORT? 

My biggest problem in all of this is that they did not tell me about the change. People should do what they say they are going to do and if they cannot then they should inform the people involved. 

If you fly US Air be aware your gate will change, your flight may change. You will pay to check your suit case and you will pay through the nose to eat on the plane and in the Sky Mall! There will be no TV, no radio, no blankets on the the plane, and they WILL run out of overhead space for your baggage. You will save some money though.

US Airways (the partnered carrier) canceled my return flight as I was about to jump on BART to get to the airport. The automated call I received, which I could barely understand because SF is a city and freakin' loud in every public space, said I had been rebooked on a flight leaving the following day at 5am AND connecting in Denver. I paid for a direct flight, not a Denver connection and not the next freakin' day. Calling the carrier directly and getting some other more realistic same-day options yielded better results, but I would have been far better off if I had known the flight was cancelled with more than 2 hours notice. I missed earlier options because I could not physically get to the airport in time. I will never ever ever fly this airline or their ""partners"" again."

I bought a 2 leg itinerary with US Airways operating the first leg through their Star Alliance.  My flight was delayed by an hour and late into Denver.  The connecting flight to Vancouver on United was two terminals away and I had no boarding pass yet (can't print boarding passes for connecting flights on a different airline, so I hear).  Needless to say, I was unable to make the connecting flight and needed to reschedule.  The folks at United got me rescheduled for the next morning but referred me to the US Airways desk to see about my hotel since US Airways' flight into Denver was late.

I'm still agitated that the CSR at the desk was on the phone for about 30-45 minutes ""checking"" on a hotel for me and then came back to inform me that they wouldn't be providing any accommodations since I had a 10 minute window to run through 2 terminals about 1/2 mile with my luggage to the United gate.  The 1/2 mile luggage run through 2 terminals wasn't part of my Crossfit routine and I'm out $80 for my own hotel room.

Here's a story: I've never been so frightened by an airline associate in my life.

The TSA officer explained the situation and asked the associate to help fix the problem. My associate claimed it wasn't her fault. The two proceeded to bicker back and forth with increasing volume and attitude until everyone in the general vicinity had stopped to listen to them yell at each other about good customer service and yadayada. When the TSA officer stormed off and the associate turned back to me, I thought she was going to bite my head off.

We left downtown Tempe 2 hours before our plane. By the time we arrived at the airport it was 40 min before our plane left. The agent called CARLA F.C. with the employee number 216471 told us that we were --too late-- that we cannot take the plane and need to buy new tickets. I asked to talk to a manager. She said she is ""the boss (AKA supervisor)"" and wanted me repeat aloud that I am 8 min late to check in. I asked for her ID number and name. While she was hiding her badge she was quick to call security. By the time security arrived we figured that there is actually a manager called Cheryl Munez. She told us that we could have checked in if it was 20 min earlier ( meaning 10 min later than we arrived). I was expecting some kind of half way SORRY. But, what I got was ""we cannot compensate anything"". Be kind that we don't charge for the exchange. Now I am sitting at the airport for 6 hours missing the only direct plane to RDU. 
Carla gets off being mean to customers. She misleads customers and calls the airport security frequently that security remembers her.

Dear Dr. Ballan:

Thank you for contacting Customer Relations at US Airways. We welcome the opportunity to address your concerns regarding your recent departure from Phoenix.

I'm sorry you were not able to check in for your flight. As you may already know, each airport has specific guidelines about check-in times to ensure customers and bags make it through security and to the aircraft on time. Once the check-in cutoff time has arrived, the computer system automatically restricts the ability to check any passenger in for the flight. Although I'm happy our agents were able to book you on the next flight with available seats, I realize this was a frustrating situation for you.

For Phoenix specifically, if you're checking bags at the ticket counter, you must check in at least 45 minutes before departure. Because the 45 minute requirement was not met, you were not able to be checked-in for flight 1550.

Thank you for giving us this opportunity to address your concerns. We realize you have a choice when flying and we thank you for choosing US Airways.

Sincerely,


Sara Berk

I travel for business and this is the airline that i sometimes have to travel because of the flight schedule works with my... unfortunately. I literally cringe with this company. 
The flight that the flight attendant ""hated her job""... flight UA4551... she was rude and hated being there... She slammed cabinets and sounded as if she was board talking on to us during her safety speech and when we landed. 

The flight that got me to finally type this review out was flight US Airways 52 Minneapolis to Phoenix. My flight arrived late to Minneapolis which lead us to leave Minneapolis 35 minutes late and I missed my connection to Phoenix by 10 minutes. They did give me amenities for the night (they couldn't get my luggage) and they didn't give me food vouchers. They put me up in a crap hotel in Phoenix. There are actually stains on their comforters.
My flight I missed was to Ontario California from Phoenix. I pre-paid for a upgraded seat. When the ""customer service"" representative was re-booking my flight, she was going to put me on an exit middle seat after I had paid for a up-grade window seat. When I asked her to change my seat she was okay about it but wasn't happy she had to call someone to get it done. She actually tried to convince me that it was okay to sit in the exit seat that would recline.  

This company needs to update their planes. their seats are old and dirty. The planes carpet is stained and old.

Thank you for contacting Customer Relations. We appreciate it when customers take the time to share their concerns. Thank you for taking the time speaking with me today.

I have carefully reviewed everything in your file based on your continued concerns regarding the security issue with the Phoenix Gate Agent.

Anyway, I had a credit to use, and use it I did.  The whole experience went strangely smooth.  I got email reminders, checked in online, got to the airport on time, and the flights left more or less on time.

My biggest gripe is the outrageous cost for any seat that is not the middle.  I pre selected my seats a month ago and no charges were visible.  Needless to say, this was not the case when checking in the day before.  The one small mercy of a connection is not being stuck in the middle for an extended period, I had to get up to leave the plane."

Nevertheless, I was given a $200 voucher for a future flight due to the massive delays. This was a good thing. 

However, when I called to make the reservation with the voucher, it was 1 hr beyond the 1 year expiration date... literally just one hour. The reservation agent told me that she was locked out of the system due to the expired voucher and could not process it. Who can help?... She advised that I contact customer service, and does customer service have a phone number? No, they do not talk to people. They can only be reached via the automated contact form on the site. 

So, I contacted them via the form. Three days later I received an email back stating that my voucher would not be honored even though I was only one hour away from it still being valid when I called to make my reservation.

What I do like is that you've got plenty of options. As noted, they are indeed a big carrier at this 'port, so you've got a bunch of departures and arrivals to choose from, and you can link up to a lot of places across the US. 

Are they my favorite carrier? Hardly. Kinda chintzy. But they sometimes win the price/convenience war and they're not so bad that you won't take them up on saving a few bucks every so often in PHX."

They don't say a word until I get to the airport, too late to head back.

And do they offer any sort of compensation for wasting my day? No. I'm not even sure I got a proper apology. USAIR = delays, bad service and a never apologize culture. Usair, You owe me my day back.

I will avoid flying with them in the future."

Well they did put us on a later flight which was kind(*), but we went to the gate and saw our original plane boarding yet they couldn't let us on.  Stupid and bureaucratic!  Southwest would not have kept us off our flight due to spite.  I'm done with US Airways.  Southwest at least has common sense."
2013-05-23,US Airways,BKB6UYDNUxHQ97pp5qOwEQ,1,"How in this day and age can you still have airplanes without WiFi?! What century is this again? Flew out of SFO for a Phoenix layover to Detroit. The first leg (the shortest leg) had WiFi but the almost 4.5 hour portion did not. How can that be?! 
And guess what on the return trip it was the exact same thing plus an older plane. I asked the flight attendant about this and she said they were still trying to get WFi on all of their planes. Inexcusable! 
And I heard on the news that they're raising the price on changing flights up to $200.
I hope I never have to fly you again.
Cheers!"
2013-06-01,US Airways,PQz-y5KY4izRl93HQ-KXFg,1,"I booked a ticket through US Airways from SFO-TPE (Taipei, Taiwan) about three months ago. At the time, we were not given the opportunity to select seats when we booked the tickets online. Since then, we've been given the run-around on how to acquire seats. Most people are probably thinking, what is the big friggin' deal? Well, being newlyweds, traveling to Asia for our honeymoon, being able to next to each other on a 13-hour flight IS a big friggin' deal!

Here's the gist of the rhetoric that is given to us after about 20 phone calls spanning the last few months:

US Airways: We don't have access to their seat maps. This is a flight operated by EVA Air, please contact them.

EVA Air: You booked the flight through US Airways, so you need to get your seats from them.

US Airways: There is no way we can assign you seats. Since this flight is operated by EVA Air, call them for seat assignments.

EVA Air: You booked the flight through US Airways. Have them make a request for seat assignments, THEN we will assign you seats.

US Airways: I don't know how to submit such a request, but have asked my supervisor to do so.

(a month passes)

US Airways: We still don't see confirmation of seating assignments. Call EVA Air to have them assign you seats. They're the operating airline for this flight.

EVA Air: You booked the flight through US Airways, so they need to make a request for seat assignments. We are not able to pull up your records from the Confirmation Code or the Flight #s because those are ones associated with US Airways. Call them for seat assignments.

US Airways: We cannot assign you seats because it's operated through EVA Air. We can put in a generic request. 
_________________________________________

Mind you this conversation has gone on for the last three months, neither airline able to give us our seat assignments. This basically means we have to show up at the airport and take whatever seats are left. Most likely they won't be together nor will we have the aisle seats we requested. 

On both ends, they keep pushing the responsibility onto the other airline. It's always, ""We can't do this."" ""We don't do this."" ""We don't have access to this."" 

Seriously, why partner with another airline when you can't do something as simple as assign seats to your customers? We are well into the 21st Century, and it's the year 2013. If you can't put a seat map on the web for customers to select seats when they're purchasing the ticket, you need to revisit Corporate Efficiency 101. How is it that requests are put in time after time with no response from EVA Air, and NO ONE does anything about that? There is a communication breakdown somewhere, but no one cares enough to do anything about it (citing ""it's not company protocol to contact the other airline about this matter), nor do they want to want to improve upon this issue. 

Think twice before booking a flight from US Airways operated by a foreign airline. Actually, don't even think about it. Just don't do it!"
2013-06-06,US Airways,gRO4iiboKN2Okqau-hEncw,1,Fly another airline.  Best advise I can give!
2013-06-15,US Airways,5LJjp2jXkNxQRIn__O-gWw,4,One of the nicest airlines to stand-by passengers!
2013-06-23,US Airways,s7r8EskMJWfJq9NNdy6hrg,1,"First time I flew with them, and I have to say I encountered the most rude employee at the Phoenix airport. 

The airport was completley dead and I wanted to see if my mileage got added to my ticket. I noticed there was a worker on the phone for 30+ minutes at an empty gate that I was waiting at, so I finally walked over. And waited. Another passenger asked me if I was waiting and that finally cued her to ask her what I wanted. I told her (while she was still on a personal call) and she quickly took care of what I needed with attitude. The customer behind me asked her ""se habla espanol?"" and she said no and told her to go to customer service next door. He asked where again, and she snapped and told her NEXT DOOR! YOURE WELCOME! Then she hung up the phone and muttered a bunch of crap and left. 

If you hate your job that much then find a new one!"
2013-07-01,US Airways,-t8WZHMF75KDs-AjGKh4Tw,4,"Ok, so maybe it's because I have a little bit of status with US Airways that I'm biased for and lately, their planes that I have been on have been newer (albeit typically smaller planes than some airlines).  The staff has always been professional and friendly in my dealing with them. So, for me to be a happy camper, I just need newer planes, friendly staff, and good connections. They give me that."
2013-07-02,US Airways,lsEol2_iAcGTqqyEfJ5WIw,1,"We flew US Air weekly for months.  My fiancé purchased First class for a flight and the seat pocket was overflowing with trash and there were crushed chips all over the floor.  The response from US Air was that they would look into it.  The money had been spent so it really was not much of a remedy for us.

I flew my 4 lb. dog on every flight.  On February 1, 2013 a member from the check in crew pulled my carry on bag.  Told me I could not have one because I had a pet.  My pet was in a carrier the size of a purse and I paid $125 for the privilege.  I had nothing other than her and one carry on bag that met the overhead size requirements.  I had laptop, glasses, etc. in the bag and it was rudely taken from me.  The person in the seat next to me on the plane told me that she was behind me when I boarded and witnessed a crew that was unsure whether they were right or wrong in grabbing my bag but decided to do it anyway.  I will remember this day clearly because this happened hours before my fiance proposed.  My point in sharing this is that flying is a necessary evil to get from A to B.  We have good and bad in our lives that require us to travel.  All that most of us expect is to be treated simply as a customer.  What I see more of is this kind of gotcha mentality at the gate.  They want to collect more money to check in baggage. There is zero customer service with this carrier and I felt defeated for all the weekly travel that I had placed with them.  Go Southwest instead."
2013-07-12,US Airways,xXZGFD-OB5hQhuQkwIAalw,2,"I never truly understand how terrible their customer service is, until I fly with another airline.
I travel often (6+ times a year) with my 2 kids who have been flying since they were literally days old.  They know the drill (going through security, seatbelt, put things under seat, turn ipods/movies off, tray tables, etc).
I don't know how many times I've gotten on a plane and attendants start hounding and  keep giving us ""special attention""... Example, we are JUST getting to our seats, and they put their backpacks or something on the seat while they get seated and organized, etc and a flight attendant is barking at me ""MA'AM! BAGS HAVE TO GO UNDERNEATH THE SEAT!!!"" or a couple of times when the tray table is messed up and goes down at the slightest touch: ""MA'AM! TRAY TABLE HAS TO STAY UP DURING TAKE OFF AND LANDING!!!""  God help me if I ask for an extra sugar for my coffee.
I understand flight attendant jobs are to keep everyone safe, but do you have to be so rude about it? I also understand the Airline Industry is jacked up (especially these low cost carriers) and over-working their employees, lousy pay for what they have to do, etc.  Still, if you don't like your job, go find something else to do.
Living in the Phoenix area, well, they are convenient with their destinations and prices, but whenever I fly another airline I really notice it. Hence, my motivation to work harder so I can make more money, so than when we do travel, we can do it more comfortably."
2013-07-14,US Airways,ZCKlNGYaBnjCgWgWfVhVEA,1,"I avoid flying US Airways at all costs.  I have had a sub-par experience every time i have flown.  The employees are never very helpful for friendly, they always load the plane too quickly and back everyone up way into the jet way.  They always run out of bin space and force you check your carry ons and the plans are always fairly dirty/out of shape.  This past trip, we were stuck on the plane for an additional 30 minutes after the plane landed (part of this was without power in the Vegas heat).  The staff told us that they were having trouble lining up the jetway with the plane.  I have NEVER not had a problem when flying US Airs!  Fly Southwest.  ..at least they are friendly!"
2013-07-15,US Airways,aBWcRhP_EjbhLEeRcA1uFw,1,"I will never ever fly US Airways again! My departure city was Phoenix. We were on the runway for 40 minutes after our scheduled departure, with no explanation of why we were sitting there.  Finally the flight attend gets on the intercom and announces we have to turn back to the gate due to a ""maintenence issue"".  Really?  It took you 40 minutes to realize this?  they turn back to the gate and the problem is fixed within the next 15 minutes.  We take off to Chicago (where we had a layover).  I knew time was going to be close since we basically were getting in an hour later.  We asked the flight attendent if there is anything they can do like call the other airline so we don't miss our flight.  she said she would accounce that those whose final destination is Chicago please stay seated and let those with close connecting flights off of the plane. Of course no one followed the instructions.....or very few did.  We get there and US airways had absolutely no gate information for connecting flights.  WHY?  we get off the plane 15 minutes before our connecting flight is scheduled to depart.  we ask the US Airways customer sercvice guy right outside the gate if he could tell us where our connecting flight was flying out of.  This took a while since we had to get his attention since he was playing on the computer.  He told us terminal 1, we run all the way over there, with our 5 month old, stroller, carseat and carryon.  No one is there, no flights scheduled.  We ask someone else after showing them our ticket, they tell us termial 3, we run back that direction.  Our flight wasn't there either. meanwhile we are running and calling US AIrways customer servioce to get direction. they tell us the flight we provided them with is a American Airlines flight. WHAT? It clearly says US Airways on the top of our ticket. We go to american airlines and of course we have missed our flight.  American Airlines sends us to US Airways baggage claim as there  is no one at any ticket counters.  We tell the person there of the situation and they put us on another flight, and put us in a hotel room for the night.  Though this was not easy to get done, she was rude and questioning why we needed these accomdations!!  I could not believe it!  They told us that our rebooked flight will go out at 6:12am out of terminal 1.  We get to the hotel and are starving. We thought the voucher they gave us included food.  BUT it did not.  Even the hotel cuctomer service rep was shocked and said ""scammers"".  Basically the only place that delivered at that hour was pizza and the bill with delivery came to 50.00!!  Out of our own pockets after us airways screw up! We get to the airport 2 hours early the next morning and go to termial one as instructed.  Customer service rep tells us, you are on a us airways flight out of terminal THREE!  Here we go again..... luckily we made that flight. the next issue though is when we got to our final destination our luggage was not there as promised.  We had to file a claim for it and showed that it would be on the next flight and they assured us we would get it delivered to where we were staying by 2pm that same say.  Of course 2pm comes and goes, we called the number that transferred us to someone in India.  They tell us they see that our luggage was on the 1pm flight but they have no confirmation that it actually arrived.  We continue waiting as they told us.  It never showed up (surprise). My husband's CPAP machine was in there that he needs to breathe at night, my baby's meds that they wouldn't let us carry on were in there along with his dairy free, soy free formula and diapers.  We had to go buy diapers, wipes, formula and my husband had to stay awake overnight because he could die without his machine.  The next morning we call again and no one answers so we drove back to the airport (an hour drive) and they couldn't find our luggage.  After being consistent with them they finally find it, and it had been sitting there since 1pm the previopus day, but was not giving to anyone to deliver.  If you want a decent travel experience do not fly US Airways!!!!"
2013-07-16,US Airways,m9sjetVpQXtiWZNhdKxGOw,4,"Since I'm in a Eugene O'Neill frame of mind, I'm going to title this review as ""A Moon for the Misbegotten.""

In my review of our return flight from BOS, initially on American and ultimately US Air to PHX, I called it: ""A Long  Days Journey into Night.""  That was due to the scheduling mishap and ""equipment issues"" experienced on that trip. We were moved from a connecting flight on American, to a non-stop on US Air

After arriving in PHX, our bags were somehow where misplaced.  The AA folks in BOS promised they would get word down stairs to the baggage handlers to move it over to US Air.  Well, we arrived on time, but with no bag in the carousel as you would say.

The nice thing about traveling today, as opposed to twenty years ago is all the technology the airlines use.  They were able to locate our bag, since it was scanned in our original connecting airport of DFW. Wow. But, they weren't sure where it was just now. Ugh.

They took all our information and promised they would find it and deliver it to our front door. Hmmm I thought, but they were very reassuring and sincere about it.  So yesterday around four o'clock our doorbell rang and yes, there was our bag.  Looking no worse for it's side trip to DFW.  

But now we have a mystery.  Why did our bag have a United Airlines tag, over the original American Airlines one?  Sometimes, life is about not asking too many questions! LOL"

Also, the fact that we'd be flying back to San Francisco and I'd have to take a cab to pick up my car from San Jose.

I thought this was awesome as they usually cost more.  So, I booked those on both of my flights.  I recommend booking the second row of exit seats if possible as the first row won't recline due to being in front of the 2nd row.  Also, I think it helped to check in before most others had done so or I would definitely have not gotten those seats.  Baggage fees were $25 for my first bag and $35 for my second.  Only soda/juice/water was served onboard for free on both flights (one was 3.5 hours and the other was 1 hour).  I did buy a bag of chips that came with this yummy salsa on the longer flight for $4 which was definitely overpriced and not a lot of chips were really in the bag.  But, the salsa was delicious.

I'm a very loyal United flyer and due to a recent family emergency I needed to fly from Denver to Honolulu. Looked at United and the ticket was over $2000. US Airways was $1300 total with upgrades on both ends. 

Where do I start? From Denver to Phoenix, the ""flight attendants"" were below average of any service. Grumpy, unfriendly, blah. My upgraded ticket $99 from Phoenix to Honolulu was no extra leg room but a leather seat aka total waste of money. 

Gate agents at Honolulu when I left were rude and totally unprofessional. Told me that I was wrong and didn't know how to check in and asked why I had checked in and didn't print a boarding pass at home. Really? Why does that matter?

US Airways Flight 4427
Philadelphia to Baltimore
August 8th, 2013
Flight Cancelled

I was not late to my flight, I did not miss the date, I did everything correct. It was -your- airline that created the entire problem by overbooking all flights that came after our cancelled flight that day. The only resolution offered to us that would fly us directly to Baltimore would have been to take a flight leaving -11 HOURS- (9pm) after our originally scheduled flight (11am). That is not acceptable.

This was the answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt:

""When a customer accepts accommodations to an alternate airport, the customer assumes responsibility for the additional expenses.""

To note here, we did not ""assume"" the extra expenses. We were given no other choice if we wanted to reach Baltimore in time. We accepted a flight to DC because it was our only alternative that would get us close enough to take public transportation to Baltimore, and to meet our deadline.

I did ask if we could be provided a rental car so we could drive ourselves from Philadelphia, and that request was immediately denied. As it was, we had to spend our own money for all public transportation from DC to Baltimore so we could meet our group waiting for us in time. This is also not acceptable. It took us FOUR trains to get from DC to Baltimore in unfamiliar territory. Why should this cost be on us?

This was a second answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt:

""There are no federal aviation regulations concerning what an airline must do to compensate passengers when the carrier delays or cancels a flight. This is true regardless of the reason for the delay/cancellation (e.g., weather, mechanical, crew availability, etc.).""

So basically because it is not ILLEGAL, they are not required to help their customers in any way. Beware if you are flying US Airways in the future, I would consider otherwise. I have flown on other airlines and I have always either been provided a hotel, food, direct compensation for a future flight or alternate transportation to my exact destination at no cost to myself.

Keeping the money we paid for services you did not deliver upon is considered theft. Your airline is a poor excuse for a business, and we will never fly with you again.

Sincerely,

2013-09-26,US Airways,YnhbeRDttfpIe0695Fn9FA,3,"I don't think that US Airways has a lot of flights through Phoenix as they seem to have hubs or more flights out of other cities like Houston and Charlotte.  Nonetheless, the flights have been pretty good with no delays yet.  At the same time, there's nothing too special about the flights as well and the biggest issue that I have is that they don't honor my FF status on their partner airlines."
2013-09-29,US Airways,wLG-VmKyfW17Qmb1XO6wpg,1,"So call me naive for I don't know much about air travel but I do know enough about customer service. what I can tell you is the attendants on this plane were so rude I couldn't even fathom if this flight was real.
My flight had a stop in Phoenix and I wasn't trying to pay $10 for food so I stayed on the plane, an attendant had approached me and said ""that's weird why are you still on this plane"" I told her I wasn't hungry and she replied with ""uh k well there's a cleaning crew coming on and you're in the way."" She then proceeded to move my things! 
After I was so fed up with this women I started to look for my boarding pass, which she informed me that i mind as well just stay now cuz i wasted all my time, until then it occurred to me my boarding pass was under my cup on the tray table and must have been thrown away. After explaining that to the women she only said ""well that's not our fault now is it?""

Never again will I be flying US Airways"
2013-10-07,US Airways,qtVuyxyXIsAIclY-YeAm5w,1,"Very disappointing service on a recent US Airways flight (or rather, non-flight since my flight was canceled and then delayed/overbooked).

Long story short: I missed my best friend's wedding in Washington because US Airways canceled my morning flight, then couldn't guarantee me and my guest a spot on the next flight.

Being canceled and then delayed would have been egregious enough, but it's the incompetence of US Airways staff that did it for me. I was never offered to option to fly Alaska Airlines, their partner agency, and I only found out about that option from other re-booked passengers (that option was, of course, sold out when I went to inquire about it).

When attempting to fly on the 8 p.m. flight, I was told my guest and I could not sit together, but if we wanted to pay $31 each for 'premium' seats, we could. How convenient.

I would think waiting for 10 hours in the airport would qualify us for seats together or, god forbid, access to the US Airways lounge, but apparently my guest and I didn't deserve those options either.

I've lodged complaints with US Airways and with the DOT, and I encourage those who have similar bad experiences do so as well."
2013-10-07,US Airways,9AAa5hw6riwYE3QRl_rzqg,1,"I have 3 words for you: FAKE BOARDING PASSES

In 2009 we tried to fly to Costa Rica from Toronto at Christmas time, BIG MISTAKE. To make a long story short our flight out of YYZ was delayed by 3 hours (even though it was showing on-time on the website when left our house, we were later told by American Airlines that apparently the flight crew was late) and we spent 3 days alternately standing in line-ups or sitting from morning until night in various airports on stand-by for flights because we couldn't make our connection. We were passed around from one enormous line-up to another (only to be sent back again) and got sent all over the USA. We went from Toronto to Charlotte to Dallas to Florida and finally to San Jose, Costa Rica, receiving some bogus boarding passes in the process. Boarding passes that they took from us and refused to give back. This part involved US Airways' partner American Airlines (the AA representative told us that the flight had been oversold weeks ago and there were other passengers already in the seats we had showing on our boarding passes.) and some unfriendly back and forth between the two. And of course you dare not make a scene in an American airport, no sirree bob otherwise those G.I. Joes will be all over you like white on rice. We were all ready to explode, especially after the second day when our luggage managed to get on a flight, but we didn't so we were at the motel with only the clothes on our backs. Motel folk were really nice though, and they gave a discount to stranded travellers. We missed out on a 3rd of our 9 day trip (all pre-paid) and were not compensated 1 penny by US Airways or GAP Adventures. All the gory details took 3 single-spaced pages to spell out, but suffice it to say avoid US Airways and avoid traveling during Christmas if you can."

On the way back, the plane from Charlotte, NC to  Austin, Texas was HOT!  We were delayed about 30 minutes for ""maintenance issues"" however once aboard the plan I'm not sure what they fixed!  The bathroom toilet would not flush in the front of the plane.  The sink in the bathroom was full of water that would not drain.  And the plane did not cool off until about an hour into the flight.  While on our vacation, we heard a comedian say that the theme of US Airways was ""Come fly the other airlines!"" and I think I may have to listen to that logic!"

Honestly, they could win awards for how truly horrible their onboard tea is. When I took that first fateful sip of this lukewarm beverage with it's hints of stale cigarettes & feet - I knew - me and US Airways would not be fast friends.

Now tea seems a little bit ridiculous to fixate on, it being such a small part of the trip, but trust me, if you had to sit with that unfinished pool of liquid in front of you for a half hour, you'd write a review too. But my rating DOES have other sources.

The whole experience just seemed a little run down. 

The row in front of us had a broken seat, that wouldn't sit upright properly, so when the flight attendant came around at take off to ask for seats in the upright position... it wasn't going to happen. Not unless the woman was forced to uncomfortably hover in front of the chair back during take off and landing (with no weight on it, it sat properly). To my total dismay, this is what she was asked to do and spent take off and landing in this weird limbo. Honestly, is the two inches the chair leans back REALLY that life and death?

And like most airlines, they charge out the wazoo for everything from baggage to snacks. There were no fresh food options on our flight as well, so I had to skip breakfast. 

And have you ever noticed airlines don't recycle? I watched garbage and newspapers get pitched into one big bag. You'd think by now they'd have learned to separate their recyclables.

What they do right and what earned them the second star is:

1. The seats are pretty comfy... when they are not broken.
2. If you can bare bones it and take travel on - this airline is pretty cost effective.

We'll see if they make up some by the return trip but so far the verdict is: Meh."

I've flown US Airways 27 times in 2013 and put up with lots of little imperfections as overall I enjoy flying their service.  However, I will be finding a new airline for 2014 (too bad I have 5 more flights booked/paid for this year).

Bottom line I decided to drive from Phoenix to Palm Springs with a friend instead of flying on my reserved/paid for flight. No big deal - I just wasted a few $ and instead drove.  It's not the first time I've not flown a leg of a round trip ticket on US Airways.

Imagine my surprise when I found out they cancelled my return flight to Phoenix.   I didn't panic, just called them to have it corrected. The very nice customer service person said no worries, he could get me on the flight.  Short term relief.

Then he said ""well a new flight is less than the $200 change fee.""  I replied that's ok, I already paid for my ticket. He said that wasn't their policy blah, blah, blah.   (I decided to be nice, he's the messenger, not the policy maker). 

Unfortunately that is the flight I must take in the morning or I would have booked another airline or rented a car or ridden a train if I had to. Instead, US Airways charged me a 2nd time for my ticket home.  

That is offensive. Southwest here I come!"

The agent at the customer service department said that ""it appears that our agent at Phoenix international did not handle the situation appropriately"" however as opposed to offer to reimburse me for my stolen property the agent attempted to pass the buck to TSA. TSA, rightly so, responded that since their agent was not involved in any fashion it is not TSA's responsibility to reimburse me for the stolen property.  Since my property was forcibly removed from me by the US airways attendant/supervisor it was US Airways responsibility to provide reimbursement for the stolen property.

The flight attendants in flight told us we would make our flight 'no problem,; and we all ran from A to B gates.    When we arrived to the gate, they had JUST shut the door. The plane was still parked. People from our SAME previous flight made it onto the plane before us and they had just gotten off the Philly flight just before us...    In flight,  we were told to 'move to empty seats in the front', but then i was ridiculed by a 'passenger-US Air flight-attendant for moving seats when we still had '40 minutes left of flight.'       We explained to the man at the door that my mom was a stage 4 cancer patient and needed to get on this plane in order to make it to a very CRUCIAL doctor appointment.    Then the man, who goes by John D. on his name tag, said ""You must have not run fast enough."" We are now stuck in Phoenix and will not be making it back to our hometown for my moms doctor appointment.       In flt attendants should have called for transport to get us to our gate on time,   or they should have contacted the front desk/tower to let them know we had just arrived from Philly (late because of US Air and not our fault) and to hold the plane for a few minutes.

2013-12-28,US Airways,_Oduyivb-geOzCqbk9upoA,1,"This is part US Airways and part United but I booked through US Airways so I feel the fault lies with them.

I don't even know where to begin. I booked my flight July 16th from AZ to MI for Christmas. I got a couple emails with minor changes in arrival/departure time, no big deal.. Then the day comes for me to fly out, the red eye from Phoenix and I'm only able to check in to the first half of my trip... They don't have enough room for everyone's carry on and want to check my baggage but since I don't have my complete itinerary they can't and I have to stand and wait while everyone else boards while they try to locate me in the system unsuccessfully. I'm eventually allowed on the plane where there is plenty of room for luggage in first class.  I suppose PHX to ORD on US Airways went fairly smooth.. Then I arrived in Chicago at 5am after no sleep for my connecting flight to Grand Rapids. I am supposed to now fly United, so I book it to their terminal about a 20 minute walk, go to their customer service desk for boarding pass since it wouldn't let me check in online and they can't find my reservation so after a couple of calls I finally got the pass printed and I make it to Michigan. 

The way home is when the real fun begins. I try to check in again online and I am unable to. I have my itinerary that states the first part of my trip is with ""other airline"". Well that narrows it down. I first try United since that is who I took the connection through on the way here and they say it looks as though my reservation had been wiped from the system. I got there at 4:30p since I didn't know what airline it was and was finally dealt with by 5:15. I am told the flight is overbooked and they are going to need volunteers or I won't get a seat.. The seat I booked and paid for over 5 months prior. I'm offered $200 and money for dinner to volunteer my seat but I have a connection to make and a cat at my apartment that is going to run out of food! I am told to sit and wait at the gate and talk to the agent there. Flight is supposed to leave at 630 and someone finally announces they need volunteers around 6. I see a couple people go up so I sit and wait thinking things are good.. Then they start to call zones for boarding! I go up to agent and tell him I don't have a seat and he sees that I am not on the standby list. He is scrambling and calls someone with a late connection and asks her to volunteer which she reluctantly does. He asks for her seat and come to find out she is on standby as well! They board the plane and she and I stand and watch the plane take off. (She ended up taking the later flight to Chicago which was then delayed and she missed her flight). I am told they will figure something out for me. I sit for about 45 minutes while they make some calls.. I will take the 8:20 flight to Chicago, missing my connecting flight to Phoenix. At this point I have been at the airport for 3 hours already and agree wanting to get home. I was offered a hotel and a 7am flight to Phoenix. This staff did work diligently to solve the issue and I was given $400 flight voucher but it's unacceptable. The 8:20 flight through American Airlines is delayed until 9, all food places are closed at this point and I've been at airport for almost 5 hours by the time I finally leave Grand Rapids. I was told I had to find United agent for hotel which was another 20-30 minute walk and then another 20 minute walk to shuttle and 20 minute wait for shuttle. I finally get to hotel around 10:30 Chicago time. I try again to check in online for my morning flight and cannot. I call US Airways since that's who I am flying out through and they tell me United has to release ticket since they did the booking. It's about 1am when I finally get off phone with United who tells me I can only checkin at airport through US Airways. I get 3 hours of sleep and off to the airport for my flight. I try to checkin and am told to go to another line and talk to someone else.. I wait a half hour before finally talking to someone and she tells me the flight is overbooked and United never officially reserved seat for me! She is on phone for 20 min or so while I am starting to cry at this point. She is able to get me a seat in the last row when I had been told by United I would have a good seat by the window for all my trouble. I'm so happy I'm going home I don't care.. Until I spend the 3.5 hour flight listening to the flight attendants bitch (excuse my language but that is exactly what they were doing) about their job, customers on the flight, how tired they were yesterday and if something happened their reaction time would be off, a pilot demanding ginger ale for his alcoholic drink, and complaining about people using the bathroom. My god, I left the plane with a full bladder so they didn't have one more thing to talk about. I think I would've rather drove the 2400 miles. United somewhat reimbursed me but this is on US Airways."

That was close to 10 years ago, the last time I flew with them. 

Then, on the flight back to Phoenix, we had to be detoured to Memphis due to a fuel pump failure. After we land, they figure out that no one there knows how to do repairs on our specific type of plane (probably because it was ancient). Great. They tow us to another terminal and apparently someone there knows something because we eventually take off again. We arrive in Phoenix 3 1/2 hours late. Then it takes more than 1/2 an hour for the luggage to start coming off the carousel- at a f*cking trickle. You would think someone might have hustled to avoid a riot from the already pissed off passengers.

Advance to 2014 and I have some miles left that if I don't use I forfeit. So I decided to take a trip to Vegas. The flight out was only a few minutes late - not bad. The return flight? Well I'm still waiting to get home and I'm on standby for the next 2 flights - both of which are oversold. Tried to work with an agent to see that my options were and rudeness and lack of empathy don't begin to describe her behavior. Never even an apology - no service recovery attempt at all. I've written to their customer service department and will update this review when/if I get a response. 

So this will be the absolute last time I use this airline and gladly so. Even a ""free"" trip using miles isn't worth the way I've been treated today. 

Use a competitor - you'll be better off. Good luck out there."

2014-03-03,US Airways,rTycPaqSpnjzl1uiOmERlw,5,"Has your heart ever gone out to an employee that you see being unfairly pressured by his colleagues who just don't understand?
Mine has.
And it did today with John B at PHX.  He's a very civil gent, and he was helping me at the US Air gate with my reservation and my seat.  As he helped me, he got a call over his walkie from another staffer who was pretty much giving him grief about not being at another gate to help her.
What she didn't realize was that John B was putting out multiple fires where he was, all by himself, as he was understaffed.  An older lady had lost her cell phone and he was plotting strategy with her for retrieving it.  Passengers were in line and the plane was boarding.  Etc etc.
But he stayed steady and just handled things one at a time.  He actually couldn't help me with a seat change.  And that was fine.  I could see he was juggling a lot so I thanked him and moved away.
Two minutes later he walked up to me and said ""were you the one looking for a window?""  I said ""yes"".  He led me back to the counter and found me a better seat.
Courtesy and personalized follow-up in the midst of a gale of bustling mayhem! 
Thanks, John."
2014-03-05,US Airways,6H7m-lCFuOBDM5RqQAUmVQ,2,On the way to cabo I decided to surprise my friend with an first class upgrade for her birthday. $150 each for the upgrade for a 2 hour flight was a disappointment.  To be honest virgin America main cabin is nicer.  Our flight attendant was too busy eating to realize everyone from coach was using the first class cabin bathroom. Another disappointment was the snacks... Or lack there of... Wow a bag of pretzels! Felt like Southwest Airlines to me. No movies and our feet didn't even recline.  Again virgin America regular seats so much better than first class us airways.  Price not worth it.
2014-03-10,US Airways,lhAl_jgDStDm6AkhiEBn1Q,3,"Our flight from Chicago to PHX was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 2 hours. I was ok with that, b/c I would rather fly at a later time than on a broken plane. Thank you captains of flight 606 from ORD to PHX 2/26/14!!! (seriously, keep it safe) 
We ended up flying 12 hours later out of MKE direct to PHX. Unfortunately our bags did not. They went to the lovely and dreaded LAX. Benito and Carmen at the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, with US Airways (I believe they were us airways employees, but it was the first day of the merge between us and american airlines) worked their bums off to locate our luggage and make sure it was on the next flight from LAX to PHX. Unfortunately American Airlines does not keep track of it's luggage, and could not tell Benito or Carmen if our bags were loaded onto the 930 flight from LAX to PHX.  US airways does keep track of this, so it was obviously frustrating for these two who were trying to help so much. Our bags ended up arriving at on that flight, but not found until 1220 am the following day. We picked them up the next morning, after they were again ""lost"" for a while. 
The only bad thing I have to say  (and I wish I would have gotten this woman's name) is about an old lady employee that was working at the counter with Benito and Carmen the night of 2/26/14 (the first day of the merge-so I'm not sure if it was all former US airways employees or if they also now had American airlines employees working the same counter) this woman was incredibly rude. She obviously can not handle stress. She was ""helping"" a man with severe** burn scars (I mention this because maybe someone will remember this woman), he was soft spoken, and seemed to not want to draw any extra attention. The old lady employee however was loud and rude for absolutely NO reason. If I had her name, I would blast it out to every outlet possible. 
Benito and Carmen get a GIANT GOLD STAR for their hard work and compassion. Thank you!!!! Shame on the old lady next to them."

Results: Our car rental agency was closed causing us to miss half a day of touring the area and 4 cab rides. Numerous passengers missed their ongoing flights.
The guy next to me said his US Airways flight that brought him to PNX out of Tucson was 2 hours late as well.

To add insult to injury, they don't even give you a tiny bag of pretzels any longer.

Never again if I can help it."

( our flight want scheduled to leave for 40 minutes.) They sent us to a rebookng line with 2 agents to help hundreds of people.  They mis-handled

Having flown with them 3-4 times over the years I just can't picture myself flying with them again unless they make some major changes. From customer service, the morale of your attendants, baggage fees, and multiple delays, why choose US Airways when you have better alternatives? Pay a little more and avoid the headache"

We had premiere access so we were able to check our luggage in a line with basically no wait at all and through security pretty quick as well. If we didn't it would have been at least an hour wait just for the bag check alone. I have never see such a zoo trying to get to a destination outside of Disney World. If you did not take this into account when coming to the airport then good luck making your flight."
2014-03-26,US Airways,8xeLmZIO7d0kOEiL24wYnw,1,"My 70 year old father had a ticket on US Airways yesterday going from Austin to San Luis Obispo, CA to visit his 99 year old father.  He was scheduled (with a ticket) to transfer in Phoenix on a 10:00am flight. His flight out of Austin was delayed(due to US Aiways) and his flight came in at 9:48am.  Instead of waiting for their connecting passengers US Airways decided to instead leave early at 9:55am leaving passengers with paid tickets behind.  The next flight was not scheduled until 1:50pm.  You would think my father would get a ticket for that flight since they left him right??  Nope, instead my father was put on stand by and US Airways did NOT accomodate him on the 1:50 flight out of Phoenix.  Instead four US Airway employees that do not PAY for their tickets were put on as stand by and again my father was left behind by US Airways. The next and last flight of the day was 8:00PM.  Just over ten hours after he arrived at the Phoenix airport!  I stressed to my father to please ensure he could get a ticket/confirmed seat for that flight and not be put on standy by again because at this point I realized US Airways would have no problem with him sleeping in the airport overnight.  I will say that my father was confirmed on the 8pm flight and he did finally make it to San Luis Obispo 11 hours after he was scheduled to.  But what is unacceptable, 100% opposite of good customer service and good business practice is that my father's original US Airways flight arrived to his destination 15minutes early!!!  Had they just waited for the connecting passengers 10 minutes he would have not spent 10 hours in the Phoenix airport and everyone else on the flight would have still made it to their destination on time.  Seriously US Airways you deserve being the lowest rated airlines in regards to customer service and now I completely understand why you are.  So when you are trying to decide what airlines to book with and you have a connecting flight keep in mind that US AIRWAYS WILL NOT WAIT FOR YOU, INSTEAD THEY WILL LEAVE EARLY AND LEAVE YOU BEHIND!!!"
2014-03-26,US Airways,9jQhHmDpIelTVmXXclfsjA,2,"The ticket agent that ended up helping us gets 5 stars. BUT this airline does NOT. My boyfriend and I booked our flight through Expedia and we purposely both did it next to each other on our laptops so we would be sure to have seats next to each other. We chose our seats successfully and went on with our day. When we got to the airport and printed our boarding passes however, our seat assignments were completely separated. 

Apparently when you book through a third party, such as Expedia, ""reserved"" is not the same as ""confirmed."" So the seats are just requested but are subject to change. Apparently we needed to call the airline to confirm the seating arrangements after we booked on Expedia. BUT this was not mentioned whatsoever!!! It confirmed our seats on our tickets online and that was that, but low and behold surprise! Nope! 

This is an idiotic rule, and if they really make you call the airline to be assured of your seat than say so! Luckily though, the ticket agent who gets 5 stars ended up getting us seats together right before we needed to board, so it worked out. Oh and they charge $25 for a checked bag--I know other airlines do that as well (not JetBlue!!!) but seriously, if they have enough money to buy out American Airlines, they have enough money to give us a free checked bag, or at least not $25 per checked bag, that's $50 added to the cost of your ticket for a roundtrip. Ridiculous."
2014-04-03,US Airways,JnesUbkE-Re8bOA4Nt52rg,2,"There is not a lot about flying that makes you happy. The seats are tiny and crowded. They herd you like cattle in and out of the plane. The flight crew is not terribly friendly. They charge you for everything..gee, would you like to get on the lane ahead of these other folks, give me 26 bucks to cut the line. Gee, would you like two inches more leg room, give me 98 bucks. We as consumers wanted cheap airlines and low fares, so I guess our only recourse at this point is to commiserate about it."
2014-04-17,US Airways,p8mxjSs232q0ujbv5hbpdQ,1,"Sharing my experience. My flight from San Francisco to Phoenix was 35 minutes behind schedule.However I was fortunate (or maybe unfortunate) to have a 1 hour and 10 minute layover in Phoenix. Not sure what happened but when arriving in Phoenix I only had 24 minutes to get to my next gate by the time started deboarding it took about 10 minutes for the plane to deboard enough to get to me and the door. As soon as I got off I ran from A25 to B2. I'm a pretty good runner and I was able to run on the fast walkways which helped. I literally got to the gate at 8:01pm and the plane leaves at 8:10pm. As soon as I ran up they pointed me at another lady and said go talk to customer service and pointed a little aimlessly to who I thought was another lady that was going to get me on my flight. I asked the other lady who I thought I was being directed to if she was customer service, she said no customer service is around the corner. I had a sinking feeling at this point. I waited in line behind two other people and was up to the desk in a few minutes as it was 8:05pm by this time. Customer service said they could not let me on the plane. No other flights that US Airways could work with and they had none for the night. I am stuck in Phoenix for the night. They did give me a hotel, but my clothes were checked in complementary checking as they ran out of overhead space on the previous flight. A couple of things that could have been done very different, as well as impacts to my life.

1. Typically when flights are behind the airline asks that anyone having a tight connecting flight be allowed to deboard first.
2. A minute late to the gate seems ridiculous to not allow me on. Maybe you boarded quicker than expected but you knew I was coming I would have expected you to accommodate me especially when you are the same airline that screwed up in the first place.
3. I don't have any clothes to wear tonight so I'll be in my work clothes, and have to get up early to fly back to SLC in my same clothes. It would be nice if you had a complimentary kit for me even a long t-shirt or something that I could use.
4. I was told well at least you get a free breakfast at the hotel. Nice looking at the positive until i get to the hotel and find out my flight leaves to early for me to enjoy the breakfast. It seems like it just keeps piling on.
5. My family was sad I have two little children at home and they are sad that their daddy was coming home like they thought. My wife also said she was sad but she likely is happy she get s a big bed to herself.
6. We had to interrupt my job I will miss out on two key meetings one internal and one with a client.
7. It will interrupt my wifes work to allow for this flight delay. I miss out on half a day of work time, and my wife now has to miss work time to come get me. I did ask the customer service rep how that works and she says well we don't offer a service so you can pay for a cab and then call customer service and see if they can do anything. That comment didn't instill any confidence especially when the results from this company have shown that I shouldn't trust them.

If the Airline would like to reach out to me feel free. I would like to see how we can change this post into a more positive one but I will leave it unchanged until you contact me."

They offered to check my bag in. So, I walked over to my seat and asked a 3rd attendant for help. He jokingly have me a hard time, but did it.  I was in no mood for jokes.  I've flown with Southwest for years consistently and I've never seen them turn away anyone who needs assistance.  I will never fly with US Airways again! Flight 510 leaving PHX to SMF at 1:36 pm."
2014-04-25,US Airways,0Kdx-xRUciyiBVyerUng7w,1,"One of the worst check in experiences at PHX, but very consistent with poor US Air check in processes across the country.  It is quite obvious that the layout designer and process engineer responsible for the check-in ""corral"" have zero practical experience in queuing theory and capacity planning that strives to remove bottlenecks not exacerbate then.  The check in in experience is poor and an in effective use of US Air personnel,  which undoubtedly impacted my high ticket price."

There, of course are no more flights that night but my delay, of course, is not their fault. So rebooked on the first flight in the morning and given a discounted hotel certificate. Come to find out...there were 17 people who showed up to the door within 5 minutes of it closing. No rude employees...just cold and uncaring. Will do my best to avoid this airline in the future."

What an embarrassment.
2014-04-28,US Airways,poXbJi7IYQst9n77RNGPGQ,1,"You should know that if you plan to take a pre-seven o'clock flight from Burbank, the plane cannot take off until 7 due to that fact that the neighborhoods surrounding the airport don't want to put up with the noise until they have to.  That means if you have a 6:40 flight, the plane will sit on the tarmac for 20 minutes before it can take off.  What?  Why not just schedule the first flight for 7:00.  Now all of those pre-seven flights are going to arrive late messing up everyone's schedules.  Does that make any sense?

You should also know that if US Air's planes are too heavy to take off or land in regards to specific airports, they will have to sit at the gate burning off excess fuel.  Again, what?  Why is US putting in so much fuel that it has to then be burned off?  Prices are already too high as it is, now we can add wasted fuel to the list of causes of higher ticket prices.  Again, passengers arrive later than expected and may miss connecting flights as a result.

US Airs response to questions about these concerns?  US Air seems to blame government regulations for late/missed flights.  Why?  How did government regulations cause an airline to load on too much fuel, or schedule planes to leave an airport at the wrong time?  

US Air along with their partner, American, do not compensate passengers for problem flights.  Disappointing first experience with US Air, which will also be my last."

Kudos to pilots, but they have incompetent and rude stewardesses (some of them are both), and they boarded three flights leaving at the same time at the same two gates, meaning they boarded one early, one too quickly, and one late.

So if you're stuck in customs because Phoenix only sees fit to have three boxes open, you better wish they decide to board your flight late or you'll never make it."

I had to pay for my baggage to Costa Rica ( I didn't have to pay for it on the way back) they told me it was part of the US so I had to pay for baggage.  I was only allowed to check in 30 mintues early for an international flight (really?!). Then on the first flight we had an exit row which was very cold. I ask a flight attendant for a blanket in which he responded ""I will have to ask a first class passanger if they are willing to part will a blanket"" I said don't bother the first class passangers. 
To follow the flight attendants we rude or very short. No notice from the pilot when we were about to land either from the flight there or back.
The flight back was a bit more annoying. First departing from costa rica after we had gone threw the security we were not allowed to bring anything on the plane to drink. And even more so there was nothing not even a small snack offered to eat on a 5 hr flight enough tho the flight attendants were carrying food  from one end of the plane to another so the flight attendants could eat but no one else.

2014-06-20,US Airways,g3o5aFb_wOJkzsOYoWATmg,3,"***US Airways out of Phoenix International Airport is decent; they have lots of flights and the boarding process is fairly quick; planes seem to arrive and depart on time as well; the waiting area feels quite crowded though and the Wi-Fi, while free, was not that great; there are not many food options past the security checkpoint at this terminal, but there are several high-end and contemporary restaurants located in the atrium before security***

I am not sure what the parking situation is at the Phoenix International Airport, but I imagine parking here is expensive like other airports."
2014-06-22,US Airways,JO8RmzazmLNkNm3qtHFT3Q,1,"I dislike US Airways so much. It's like the people working there are incompetent and... incompetent. There's no other word for it. Told them I had an international flight to make in a hurry and they said, we can't help you. Had to wait in line... and when I got to the front, they said, International Flight is the other check in area. It was completely empty. Freaking wasted my time!

Everyone I talked to had this non-caring attitude along with not knowing what's going on. I asked them where I needed to go for International Flights after landing at SFO and they were really confused. That and they printed a non-valid International boarding pass for me at SFO. Security said I had to go back to the check in area to get another one.

Luckily, someone from Singapore Airlines saw what was happening and did something about it. Instead of making me wait in line at check in, they walked with me from going through security all the way to the departure gate and printed me another boarding pass for the flight. That's what I call service and just helping someone out. And that's why so many people like Singapore Airlines. Friendly, competent employees."
2014-06-28,US Airways,BSGSE5k0Q7fy5BbHOmcKIQ,1,What happened to US Airways? I used to fly with these guys all the time a few years back and it was fine but now it is completely ridiculous. We arrived at the airport with plenty of time (or so we thought) but due to the enormous lines that only plagued us airways customers we ended up boarding our flight just before the doors closed. Now I am sitting at the tarmac in PHX with barely enough time to.make my connecting flights and they are giving us no info or assurance that we will make it. Add this airline to my no fly list along with spirit.
2014-06-30,US Airways,u5qXNtQZVi7-EVOld6xmiA,1,"This is my first and last time flying with US airways. It is worth spending more for a different company. The flight was delayed because of weather. Fine. Not there fault. However, how you deal with that as a company and in regards to customer service is key. I missed my 2nd flight because if the delay - despite it was the same company and if they had held that plane for just 5 minutes several of us would have made it. But instead they put us all on standby on the next flight, which is full, and also deluded over an hour. Then that flight gets delayed again. Oh, and if you don't get into this flight they will not pay for a hotel. They will give you a coupon, but that's it. Worst customer service I've ever experienced with an airline."
2014-07-05,US Airways,0ksrTEqBsBDdsPAXD5elmQ,4,"We flew from phx to newark and back with a 1 year old. I was so nervous and there was no need to be. Us airways was so accommodating and helpful. Everything was right on schedule all bags, car seat, stroller was right where it needed to be at all times. The flight attendant were so helpful. They even gave us a free seat for our baby! The only thing is the flight food is HORRIBLE. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
2014-07-08,US Airways,B89EEPm1JCco_77_gAC_TA,1,"All of their ticket counters are somehow closed, not sure how a passenger is supposed to check in. Their kiosks also do not respond to touch as they are supposed to, super frustrating when they ""time out"". And the person who took my checked bag didn't say one word to me...lovely customer service."
2014-07-09,US Airways,b18khYAk764kWxTfhIWCDw,1,"Flight 2961 is not very smooth on 07/09/14. It almost has become comedic the way this company has handled this situation where the Captain didn't show up for our flight. Really???

Yeah, really. 

They boarded us and we sat for 40 minutes until some dude who looked just like Arizona Prince came aboard w/the news that the Cap't was MIA. Then they told us to deplane, but they kept us on for 12 minutes trying to figure out the luggage. That was classy as it's Phoenix in July, so it's only about 117 degrees and the tube is smelling super great. So then we deplaned and were told to line back up to get back on the plane about 5 minutes later. When we were going through the gate the dude actually told us to ""hurry up"" and be ready. I think we were all ready before. 

So now we are back aboard and thank goodness that Margie the stewardess has enough cold water to drink at the front, as we are all sweating like crazy. She seems nice, but that wasn't very cool as a lot if very old people in our flight look like they're about to pass out from hear and she is pouring water down. Reminds me of that scene from Three Amigos. 

Lame but what the heck can one do but hope for a safe flight. 

US Airways isn't very professional or organized."
2014-07-11,US Airways,UZgSs7eb5yWuAwoVWkc-BA,1,"How about. ... They over booked in the middle of the night. .2 min before boarding they want people to give up their seats. Then they still can't fly out on time and flight attendants be catching attitudes with economy class customers, changed my reserved seating back about 20 rows and everybody's seat got reassigned, and you want to give attitudes, bump into customers? No Bueno.  United Airlines compared to this airline. AND they don't offer online check in for military so they can have their baggage fees waived with pre TSA check qualification. What's the deal?"
2014-07-13,US Airways,ecr6JfFIalWdYUdSBt4iFw,1,"My family and I were flying from Austin, TX to Phoenix (final destination was Anchorage, AK) on June 28th. We had our 12 year old daughter, who suffers from a brain malformation schizencephaly, with us. She requires a wheelchair to get around in and we gate checked it in Austin. There were two tags placed on the chair. One was for the gate check itself, the other was the full itinerary. When we arrived in Phoenix, my husband saw the ground crew take our daughters wheelchair and place it in a vehicle. Well, when you gate check something, you get it when you get to the next city. Not so much with US Air!! Now, they decided that the wheelchair was going to go directly to our next gate. We had a 4 hour layover in PHX. 4 hours of carrying my 12 year old, 66 pound daughter around. Yeah, I don't think so. So when I asked our flight attendant she quickly jumped at 'we can't speak with the ground crew"" then proceeded to get herself ready to deplane. We took all of our stuff, including our other 2 daughters and my 12 year olds car seat, up to first class where we waited for the ground crew to bring my daughters wheelchair up. 10 minutes later, we were asked to deplane so they could get the plane ready for the next batch of passengers. We waited for about another 10-15 minutes in the terminal waiting for them to bring me her chair. When we finally got the chair, the lady was very rude saying ""Here's your chair"" then walking off. I will never fly US Air with my daughter again. This was completely unprofessional and unbelievably rude."
2014-07-14,US Airways,Gm5YpedjwtctXUHMhY35KQ,1,"I found out extending courtesy to US Airways penalizes the customer! First it prevented me from paying them to take an earlier flight, second they would not allow me to get my bag unless I was willing to wait two hours and then I would have to exit the airport and go through TSA again, lastly even though I explained and stated I left me medications in the bag they could only say they are sorry....What happened to courtesy and customer service ? As a courtesy I checked in my carry on due to announcement by US Airways that overhead will be full. So I thought I can do that it would help USAirways and the other passengers by leaving more room. Low and behold I get on the plan and there is plenty of overhead space. I did not realize two additional consequences would follow! My flight arrangements made by my work left me with a 4 hour layover, it's. 6:45 AM so I thought I would pay to get on an earlier flight. To my dismay, because I let them check my carry on I was told I have to stay with my bag. Wow strike one! So I go to see if I can retrieve my carry on and explain what I want to do and add that I forget to take my meds out of the bag. They responded with saying I must wait two hours and then I have to exit the terminal and go back through security. Obviously they know this whole process would take at least 3 hours. Needless to say, they have in concern or initiative to assist me even though I checked my carry on to benefit USAirways and others. I hope this review helps others from getting penalized for extending courtesy !"
2014-07-14,US Airways,30U-IJ0VADlkgcTgMol7Nw,1,"You know...  They really shouldn't give us a lot of time between flights to allow people to write reviews after their flights get canceled or rescheduled or what ever.   As I am writing this, I honestly do not know what the heck is going on, other than they are telling me that the plane designated to go to Long Beach.... will not.

Ok.  I don't want to go on a plane that is going to crash.  That would suck worse.  Current departure somewhere is almost 2 hours delay, due to aircraft maintenance.  Then, a quarter of the passengers got booted off and sent to much later flights or to other locations. My flight got sent to another gate and another plane.

There is a reason why there is a predominance of 1 and 2 star reviews; and I question anything 3 stars or higher. Either it was a ridiculously good day for the airline or they are somehow being charitable.  Regardles, I pity the staff and the passengers. 

As I am sitting in the plane now, I am thankful for the accommodation, but it doesn't change my review. Let's just hope this bugger doesn't crash.....

Wish me luck.

Continuation....  Now we are going back to the gate because the windshield heaters are not working.   Well, neither is the AC.

I like a sauna.  Should I up my review?  2 hours in the terminal and another undefined amount of time on the plane.

At least we haven't crashed (yet).

Continuation #2....  Now de - planed in Phoenix.  These are types of flights that you can't believe.  Still no information on a reschedule over 3 hours after we were supposed to take off.  Maintenence is working in heat over 100 degrees to fix the issue with some sort of sensor.

I think I'm going to keep on updating as I go.  Wow.....

Continuation #3...  Back on the plane 20 minutes ago.    Door closed and ready to move.  It's only 4 hours and 30 minutes late (so far). There are only 12 airplanes in front of us, according to the flight attendant.

Go US Airways!!!  Will see if they offer anything to make up for it.   But, I doubt it.

Continuation #4 and last.   Finally arrived in Long Beach 4 and a half hours after I was supposed to.  And, of course, US Airways did nothing to compensate.   Not even a free drink on board.

Hope you enjoyed the read...."
2014-07-15,US Airways,4_xpW38OGo29SzK2kWO4zg,2,"The line to check a bag was extremely long. It took me longer to check a bag through US Airways than it took to get through security and find my gate! This was at a time when almost no one was in the airport because it was so early in the morning, so I don't know what the holdup was.

After all that, once we tried to board the plane, my entire group was forced to check our carry on bags (for free) because they said they didn't have enough room on the airplane for everyone's stuff. My group took up several seats on the airplane, so why were other people's things in the overhead compartments above our seats? Why weren't we allowed to put things in the compartments that were included in the price of our tickets?

The reading light above my head was broken, and my chair didn't recline. The fold-down tray touched my lap when I folded it down--usually they are much higher so that people can eat off of them or rest their heads on them, etc.

Best of all, when the safety instruction was commencing, the flight attendant who was supposed to be demonstrating for the back of the plane was GONE. There were only 2 flight attendants at the front of the plane doing a safety demonstration--I guess the people at the back of the plane didn't pay enough to have our flight attendant actually show up? (She made an appearance after it was over.)

Not only that, but when I tried to look at my safety card, the paper was sealed shut. I don't know what stuff had gotten onto that paper, but I had to rip it apart to see the safety instructions. Of course, once I did that, some of the safety instructions ripped off. Clearly, they never do maintenance on these airplanes.

The safety booklet was a joke. They translated the word ""or"" into 3 other languages, but the words ""fasten your seatbelt"" weren't translated at all. What?! The customers who never got the safety demo were forced to try to decode the cryptic little pictures in the safety booklet. I honestly couldn't tell what they were doing in those pictures, with all the arrows crammed into each small box. It seems that whoever created those things wanted everyone to die. 

The flight itself was turbulent, but I guess that's not the airline's fault. The flight attendants were okay, and the plane landed on time. We didn't die, but it certainly wasn't a safe or comfortable flight."
2010-02-20,Southwest Airlines,DmEL4w_IzISD4j0ACuW1bQ,4,"So much better than other Southwest locations *cough Salt Lake City* It is conveniently located near bathrooms, Starbizzle, magazines and some fast foodie options. Our flight attendants were hilarious and good natured. The best part was after the pilots came down and one of the female attendants simply said ""We're here."" (no @#$# )... that got some laughs. I have such a love hate relationship with Southwest but at Sky Harbor we had no issues with checking in our luggage within a reasonable waiting period, no luggage was lost, and had a comfortable flight. To be continued on our second Arizona UYE (yes the plus one and  I are coming back... and you @#$#@&$ better come with us!!)"
2010-07-20,Southwest Airlines,bpYxtWMu_9nCDePiaDJkRQ,2,"I fly a decent amount of flights per year and let me tell you... Southwest Phoenix to San Diego never fails to have a delay... Today takes the cake though. First I paid extra or ""Early Bird"" check in. Well it's kindof pointless when they decide to pre-board this random group of people from some other displaced flight. 

Once on the plane already running 45 minutes behind they re-open the cabin doors because they need to board three flight attendants that are jumping to San Diego... Well we have been sitting here for about 20 minutes now and only two of the flight attendants have arrived. Delays due to bad weather or mechanical issues are one thing, but now you are delaying over 100 people so you can move one flight attendant to a different airport. Completely disappointing. I think I'm going to start using a different airline for my Phoenix trips."
2010-08-10,Southwest Airlines,EU6UETJLitaEetF8j74M0A,3,"I had a layover here, and the Southwest gate is really close to Nathan's Hot Dogs and Pizza Hut, along with restrooms. There is a lot of layovers in Phoenix, especially for flights heading to and from the Atlantic coast.

I'm giving this particular Southwest 3 stars because I found some of the employees to be rude when I was inquiring about a flight that was running an hour late without any announcements -- how was I suppose to know the flight was being delayed if the boarding time had not changed on the screen? Southwest is still a great airline, but the service could be better here."
2011-02-09,Southwest Airlines,-lEGHZa8ak_c-kYCvN-30A,3,"If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.

I'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.

Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation."
2011-10-10,Southwest Airlines,DsUYtpEFoVcjUPnUxA9ztg,4,"After racking up a million miles on 2 different majors, I never thought I'd enjoy Southwest. It's a little bit like going to a human zoo. Everything is different from the boarding process to baggage fees and even how tickets are sold (no Expedia). I love their flexibility and though they aren't 100% there for business travel, they do a wonderful job for short hauls."
2011-10-19,Southwest Airlines,meUT80q67qzWjuiKt3ws9w,1,"I wouldn't fly Southwest Airlines if they were the last airline on the planet. Period. I hope Yelp allows me to post this review with no stars because that's what they deserve. Southwest committed THE cardinal airline sin: they abandoned a traveller who was, literally, thousands of miles from home.

Southwest has the only non-stop between Phoenix and Manchester, NH. After making my reservation and paying an extra charge on top of the airfare, I was allowed to board before other passengers. The Gate Agent entered the aircraft and sat down next to me. After about 5 seconds, she asked me to follow her off the aircraft.

I was informed that my reservation, for which I'd already paid, would NOT be honored. I was deemed a ""Person of Size"" and it was her decision that I needed to buy a second seat. Oh, BTW, there are no more seats on this flight (the ONLY non-stop to New Hampshire). No, you can't fly another airline because we don't ""code share."" Your credit card will be refunded in 2-3 weeks. 

Southwest stranded me 2000 miles from my (at that time) home.

Later, after flying home on another airline, I checked Southwest's website. There was no mention of ""Person(s) of Size"", the need to buy a second ticket, or the Gate Attendant is the sole arbiter in this matter. Basically if you're more than 30-40 lbs over your ideal weight, you will be subject to this policy. I hope your credit card isn't maxed out.

Subsequently, whenever the topic of airlines comes up, I tell everyone within earshot of this experience. I was a business owner. I forbade my people from flying on Southwest. Yeah, they flew my bags for free; but they wouldn't let ME on the plane. How useful is that?

Now, I'm retired. When I need to return to New Hampshire from Arizona (roughly every other month) I fly US Air."
2011-12-28,Southwest Airlines,krafmMfjIj8D9bsDjrcEKw,2,"Normally, I would give Southwest a five. I have flown on every major airline and several not so major ones and Southwest always comes through. The flight attendants are friendly and creative. The seats are usually comfortable and have plenty of leg room. Waiting in line is never an issue and the boarding process is quick and efficient. But the last flight I had was atrocious and it was all because of the service. 

12/26/2011: Flight 944 from Austin, Texas to Phoenix, Arizona. The attendant who was covering the middle of the plain was not having a good day and she decided to take it out on the passengers. She completely skipped over my row which perhaps might have been because everyone else was already fast asleep, but I had been patiently waiting to order a drink. She looked me directly in the eye and kept walking. I thought perhaps her machine wasn't working properly and that she would be back to take my order but she never returned. 

Next, the handing out of roasted peanuts and crackers, which are not always the most delicious of treats but I had been trying to save money and not eat at the airport and was looking forward to a snack. Once again, the attendant skipped over my row. I waved my hand this time to get her attention but she never looked up from the basket of peanuts. 

Finally, the drinks were delivered and when she came to my row, I asked her nicely if I could order a drink and have a bag of peanuts. She glared at me and asked what I wanted in an impatient tone. I ordered ginger ale and she brought it a few minutes later. She didn't bring the peanuts and she didn't look at me or acknowledge the fact that I thanked her for her trouble. I thought maybe she couldn't handle a tray of drinks and peanuts at the same time so I waited to see if she would bring them separately. I waited a half hour. Looking around, everyone had gotten their drinks. 

For the first time ever, I pressed the flight attendant button. A few minutes later, she came over. I asked if I could have a snack and that my row had been skipped earlier. She huffed and told me that I would get my snack in a condescending tone that made me feel like I was being impatient. 

I learned from their announcements that all the attendants were from Dallas. The flight I was on had come from Dallas which meant that my unfriendly stewardess had barely started her shift. I tried to think why she might be in a such a bad mood, either from having to work the day after Christmas or perhaps she got into a fight before she left or maybe it was because she got stuck with a night shift and the lines on her face suggested she may be getting too old for night shifts. 

At the end of the flight, as I disembarked, I nodded at her to see what kind of reaction I got. She squinted at me and said ""bye"" in a short and abrupt way. I couldn't help but notice that her tone of voice had been much softer toward the other guests and she had said things like ""come and see us again,"" or ""thank you, have a nice evening."" I'm not sure why she had beef with me but I have never had such horrible service."
2012-03-05,Southwest Airlines,o_5Qq0NPV03cgr4oaOZenA,1,"Flew Southwest Airlines two times before between Phoenix and LAX and once to Austin. Both flights from Phoenix to LAX were delayed one hour. Fortunately I usually plan for this sort of thing so I was OK with connecting to my international flight at LAX, but I'm sure others weren't so lucky. Plus, on the flight to Austin one of the flight attendants sang country songs and told inappropriate jokes about men and her husband over the loudspeaker for about 10 minutes-15 minutes. Some of the more ""goofy"" passengers actually seemed to enjoy ""the show."" But I prefer my airlines to stick to air travel and not comedy or music. Plus, what about those people that want to get some sleep or read? Why would they want to be subjected to this juvenile  krap? Plus you can't select your seat before the flight. You have to stand in line like cattle at the gate in ""boarding groups"" and then when your group is called to board fight off others to get a good seat. I'm a big guy so I usually win, but what about the little people?! LOL. Plus, I don't like the stress of knowing I'm gonna have to do battle with others to get a decent seat. 

For these reasons I haven't flown Southwest since 2008 and have only flown US Airways domestically."
2012-03-06,Southwest Airlines,qb52o1MugivLj5YjQhYLsw,4,"There is nothing fancy about southwest, but there's not much wrong with it either.  On my last flight my only complaint is that the air was not turned on in the plane while we were sitting there waiting for it to take off.  You are able to check two bags and take a carry on.  You get a drink and a snack on your trip although you get the snack before the drink for some reason.  The price is always right."

I was sick and out of it, and was glad I could sleep in since my flight (which I thought was at noon but I saw was 1:10 on the itinerary) so I slept in. That morning I got to the Southwest checkin counter and was shocked to see my connection was at 1:10 -- my flight was at 12:10, literally in Iike 20 minutes.  I crawled up and surrendered hopelessly, expecting due reprimand, scolding and punishment.  But the agent at the desk said with an encouraging smile ""I think if you run you can make it!"".  So off I ran. Just as I got to the gate they were boarding.  Another airline would have just said no.  The biggest shock of all was seeing my bag on the carousel safe and sound. I love Southwest and their awesome team!"

 We had the pleasure of flying on them 2x's this week.
Free to check up to 2 bags each. A very easy check in 24 hours in advance on line. Easy to check your bags when you get there. Free bag tags.
 The seating situation has really changed.  It is very organized and easy now to get on. We were so lucky to get on a very new aircraft, a Boeing 737-800.... I think the seating was 174! Great plane, clean and fresh and so smooth. 
 Southwest is given a lot of liberties to make your flight fun! 
They make a lot of really fun announcements. 4 Flight Attendants on this one and all very nice and fun.
I was surprised on a 45 min. flight they handed out 2 snacks and drinks plus a refill if you would like one.
Our return flight was just as nice. Even though our flight was 40 min delayed. They did their best to keep everyone informed and were very pleasant.  
We even got points for our miles flying on Southwest and all for a good price.
 Thank You Southwest Airlines for a really nice flight"
2012-08-09,Southwest Airlines,4HH90eli4qLrCRMUoECs-A,5,"We had a great time on Southwest Airlines last week. We flew up to Vegs for 4 days. Even though it was a short trip, it was a good one.
 The first flight we had was from Phoenix to Las Vegas. We were lucky enough to get on a 737 800 aircraft. The windows were clean and big, the plane was clean and the service was nice. Happy Flight attendents and a quick and fun flight. 
 Our flight back on Monday night was delayed, (but hey sometimes that happens). The crew did the best they could and it still a quick and very nice flight home. The terminal in Phoenix is really nice. Lots of shops and places to eat  and drink as well."
2012-11-02,Southwest Airlines,MfAbHWOpoaXQ532N6PDuPw,4,"One can say an ""ariline"" is ""an airline""...this may be true however Southwest gets my attention everytime

And here's why

1) they are people movers. They have attendants walking the checkin areas to make sure you are on time and if not, they will move you up the line so you don't miss your flight. Now then, moving you up the ladder and not intefering with other passengers? Unbelieveable. They have a separate counter to deal with the late ones.

2) 2 bags checked in free. What ariline does that these days

3) At the gate, your boarding pass is coded to board by zones. Prevents the unorderly stampede of folks trying to get a good seat on the plane

4) In flight? Attendants with humor. I've always had chuckles listening to the attendants as they annouce the comings and goings

These are just a few of their good points; solid though. Now if they upgrade their fleet, I might give them an extra star!"
2012-11-21,Southwest Airlines,Unz-X41pmf9MQw-kaQe0Sg,5,"Southwest offered the cheapest airfare at the time for a round trip from LA to Phoenix. I love that the checked in bag was free, and I don't have to spend an additional $50 round trip. 

Boarding is organized since you line up by group and number. Picking our own seats was great. On other flights, I have to negotiate to sit with someone I knew. They also offered free pretzels and peanuts. I don't remember the last time I was offered a free snack. Wi-fi is available for $5. 
 
I will be definitely choose Southwest again especially if there is a good price."

The only things I would change are:

- People willing to pay for EarlyBird Check-in should not get prioritized ahead of A-Listers who have been paying for their tickets with SouthWest for a long time
- You need to fly to Hawaii, Mexico (not just with partners, but so the SW Air perks still work) the Caribbean....oh heck, just go Worldwide."
2013-02-05,Southwest Airlines,3v1yeLm1wQdEMB0a6KvaBQ,4,"I am an A-List Preferred member so I obviously fly SWA a lot. Because I also have earned a Companion Pass that allows my sweetie to fly with me for free unrestricted, I try to only fly on SWA. I am so sick of luggage & change fees on other airlines, etc that I would still prefer to fly SWA even without my perks. Speaking of perks, my Companion Pass saves me $1,000's every year and I really maximize my frequent flyer miles to make sure I get this renewed every year. Using your frequent flyer miles is very easy and if you need to cancel, they just go right back into your account.  Their web site is easy to use and manage your account. They are pretty good at notifying you if they are running late and we always sign up for Flight Status Text Messaging to get updates starting 4 hours before the flight. Other than a couple cranky flight attendants over the years barking out the rules for sitting in the emergency exits rows (""Please respond verbally with a yes, or else...  I can't heeeeear youuuuu.""), I do not recall any negative in-flight experiences. They do tend to have flights run late on the routes we fly but we just adjust our airport arrival based on the revised departure times. These guys offer great service and value and the best frequent flyer perks. I'll take the Companion Pass over First Class seats any day. If SWA itself (not partners) flew to Hawaii and Mexico, we would never fly any other airline. The WiFi on-board is also cool if you ever need it. Wanna get away? SWA for sure."
2013-04-05,Southwest Airlines,3sUxQO0AwV0ZljAC1HXFww,5,"As a former US Airways passenger, I have to tell you.  There is no comparison.  Southwest out classes them hands down!!  They have employees who actually smile, talk to customers, shake their hands.  They even give you a snack with the complimentary beverages.  For about $100 less for my short flight, I will take less attitude, better service, and a crew who actually likes to get along act as one company not two that merged several years ago and their employees still have not gotten over it.  I have taken the Phoenix to San Diego route several times.  On US AIRWAYS, they stop service to passengers at the slightest turbulence.  Would not be so bad if it was truly an emergency but you know it is pure laziness when US AIRWAYS cuts service and then they all stand around talking.  Kudos to CRYSTAL on flight 1011 San Diego to Phoenix 625pm on 4/4/2013 for being so nice!  I really think before any merger takes effect, US AIRWAYS should send their employees to SOUTHWEST so they can learn how to treat their passengers and each other.  BTW, you may hear stories about passengers getting out of hand sometime on Southwest but they are so much better than US AIRWAYS passengers.  Very polite, they wait their turn, and they are not rude and demanding.  Although some of that may stem from US AIR's employees and trickle down do not let anyone fool you!  Southwest is a GREAT PRICE AIRLINE WITH GREAT EMPLOYEES AND PASSENGERS.  So do not pay more to be Ghetto.  GET ONBOARD WITH SOUTHWEST and outclass those who think they are better!"
2013-04-13,Southwest Airlines,wdXzHSRipy4WHmSn7BztTg,1,"FLIGHT 4038 - Phoenix to Buffalo 4-13-13

So what does Southwest Airline have control over? I think it is only fair to review a business or in this case a flight for the things they actually have control over.

For example; the rude woman who wanted to sit next to me, while I attempted to explain that my wife was sitting there wasn't Southwest's fault - that woman should just be thrown from the moving aircraft!

They also cannot really control whether the ride is smooth or bumpy - though I do believe they could try to avoid some of the big bumps when I need to pee so badly and am not allowed to get up because of the turbulence. 

Finally, the cannot control the passenger who has a horrible allergic condition of peanuts - so badly that the flight became a peanut free flight! However, I still had to eat my protein bar, which had nuts in it - but then again - I have to eat what I have to eat so my BS doesn't drop and I take precedence over the nut issue!

However, they DO have control over their flight attendants and this flight was no different then most others on Southwest. Though I have been with better - they had a good sense of humor - one in which my son didn't fully grasp, but then again he wasn't looking forward to going back home to WNY from Scottsdale AZ!  Steve was perhaps the best of the crew!

The aircraft appeared clean - it was a new one for sure 737 so they get a star for that. Otherwise - it's pretty much a basic seen it all before flight! I like upgrades to First Class!

Perhaps I was a bit too kind - I am changing this review from 2 stars down to 1 because this flight attendant is just too darn sarcastic and rude! she should be thrown out of the aircraft at 30,000 feet with the other rude biotch!

Just when you think it won't get worse - we land in Buffalo only to find out that most everyone's luggage is still in Phoenix - I was lucky - my family got two out of six bags - we only have four bags left in Phoenix. Thank you Southwest for making this trip and my families vacation one to remember!"
2013-04-18,Southwest Airlines,AjKVgX2-E-I8eV10z7S_VQ,4,"Tips if you have never flown Southwest:
-line up by boarding number 
-seats are chosen first come first serve, choose anywhere!
-generous reimbursement for giving up your seat but the ticket agents may not be so forthright about the fastest alternative to bring you home

I wound up with $400 in flight credit and only had to arrive an hour later. I was happy with my flight and didn't mind being forced to the middle as I was traveling solo."

2013-07-02,Southwest Airlines,owQ0c5Q1341SQ9bfSYfF7g,4,I am a frequent flyer and the check in line at Southwest is nearly always the longest. They get it and it is good from the popularity of this line to see that people realize it. This is an industry where many carriers lack customer service and will get business anyway.  The only thing that is going to change this  is if we all try to support the businesses that care about the customer.
2013-07-26,Southwest Airlines,_c1IizebS02xUTsOnG0Nhw,4,"Big fan of Southwest.  We fly SW a lot and appreciate that they go out of our local airport.  This flight into PHX left from FLL 40 minutes late, but somehow the pilot was able to make up the time and arrive on time.  Regardless, the second leg out from PHX to LAX was delayed 50 minutes which meant I had about an hour to hang out at the SW gate in PHX for a bit.  A little confusing holding area as the check-in desk is situated on the opposite side of the room from the actual boarding gates.  Looks like the single desk handles 3-4 gates maybe.  The check-in staff wasn't clear that the plane arriving at our gate was NOT the plane we were supposed to board, so a lot of us started lining up but there was a whole 'nother group taking the arriving plane to Vegas.  They unloaded and loaded quickly and our plane arrived just a few minutes later.

Regardless, Southwest has very straightforward policies, and excellent prices.  We use our Southwest Visa all the time and build up beaucoup points and that's a nice bonus!  I also have a nephew-in-law who works for SW and we get a few buddy passes every year which is even a bigger bonus.

Now, even though the boarding process has changed over the years (remember those plastic blue ones?), the cattle call isn't much different than it was 15 years ago.  Being 6'5, I wish the leg space was a tad longer, but at the ticket price I can't complain much.  Flight attendants and staff are always friendly and happy which must mean they enjoy their job.  Years ago, they used to sing, tell jokes, and get pretty crazy on the flights, but I think they were told to tone it down a bit.  Once in awhile they crack a nice joke or announce the ""Welcome to Chicago!"" when your flight really landed in Colorado or something like that.  Love that humor.  Keep it up SW!"
2013-09-29,Southwest Airlines,3d_zzbZbExlevaxJLrM0og,3,"I do like the airfare and no frills of Southwest, especially on shorter flights.  Phoenix seems to be a typical layover for Southwest as I travel from West to East coast and back.  The flights so far have always been on time in and out of Phoenix."
2013-10-02,Southwest Airlines,L4bfqFF_jIJZqljLPwSXaw,3,"The customer service can be hit or miss, but you can't deny the cheap airfare and luggage flys free.  If your flying with a lap child, and if there are seats available you can bring you car seat on board.  This will be more comfortable for you and the baby!  Also I would suggest bringing your stroller to make moving about the large Phoenix airport easier.  Then gate checking your stroller, so it will be instantly available to you when you land.  When gate checking a stroller or car seat, you don't have to wrap it in a plastic bag (it's optional but not necessary), found this out at the ticket counter.  Also when flying with young children, you get priority boarding, which is after A boarding.  This is better then C boarding, but still not the best seating especially if it's a packed flight or a transfer flight.  For example, my family got stuck in the very back of the plane and there was no room!  The flight attendants, however were very nice and took two drink orders, gathered trash several times, and asked if we needed anything.  Overall, a less expensive way to fly and I'll definitely be back."
2013-10-05,Southwest Airlines,JOhMqyNzuZv-LoWdKCIEeA,1,Bummer my first bad thing to say about SouthWest Airlines. A gate agent in Phoenix last week would not give me a blue pass ( handicapped ) to board early.  She said I could upgrade for $40.00.  Seriously I have a handicap and I was so insulted and stressed.  I didn't want to argue with her as it embarrassed me.  Bad job SouthWest!!
2014-01-03,Southwest Airlines,CMN-Z8eENVNspe00cRaM5w,4,"It was a very busy day at the airport this morning.  Line at check in was very long that I decided to not check my luggage in.   

Lady (I think her name was Emma or Emily) at Gate 17 around 11am was very professional. She stayed calm despite the line that was getting long in front of her and her phones ringing off the hook.)  She handled my request to change my flight to an earlier one since my original flight has been delayed 1 hour.  Kudos to her!"
2014-01-08,Southwest Airlines,_7PpyRgAFgvEDO6Mym-iJg,5,"Southwest is my airline. 
I've always preferred them. 

There are no assigned seats, which is a curse and a blessing. 
A blessing in the case of showing up early you have your choice. 
A curse, if you run a hair late, you're split up. 

We are rapid rewards members, and have Chase Visa cards - which means we are frequently sent drink vouchers. I know this isn't a huge deal, but it makes us feel valued. Sometimes it isn't the dollar value of the gesture, but the casual reminder of ""Hey we know you choose us, and we hope you continue to do so..."" 

We've had pretty good luck with baggage, very few flights that require connections, and overall very kind staff. 

In fact, this last jump from Georgia to Phoenix, we had a snag at the drop off for the rental car, and arrived at the gate about 1 minute before they were going to close the doors. They had someone WITH OUR BOARDING PASSES waiting for us, so we could walk right on. We expected to be turned away, not be treated like royalty. 

Thank you for always getting us to and from safe Southwest."

2014-01-27,Southwest Airlines,OCQlSRyz4T2KuMy9Pn9JNg,2,"So I'm a friendly sort of guy. But, I have to travel with a back brace and my pain meds. Having an artificial disc and fused vertebrae make traveling a chore, and I'm slow. I rely on the kindness of strangers for little things. 

So, I ask for pre-boarding. I have never been interrogated before like I was here. I think the spine support brace, or my paperwork if you need it, should be enough. But the agent seemed bent on making sure that he disapproved of my asking to pre-board. 

I hate the walk down the ramp, when I tried general boarding. People pass me or ask me if I need help. Well, I do pre-board and avoid the drama. 

But humiliating me and giving me his disdain felt worse. I've never had an airline treat me like this. I'll avoid SWA, at least from PHX. My pain meds kicked in, which helped take the edge off the interrogation. I hope the he never has a reason to swallow ones pride and ask for help. If he does, I hope he is not treated like he treated me.

SITREP

Okay.  So I probably should have paid closer attention to the flight-schedule when my uncle and I were making reservations for my return flight from Spokane to Sacramento.

But a layover in freakin PHOENIX?!?  Jiminy.  It takes much longer to fly to Phoenix than to Sacramento.  And THEN, it's also longer to fly to Sacramento from Phoenix than it would have been to fly between Spokane to Sacramento directly.

INSULT TO INJURY

Talk about getting the ultimate run-a-round.  What would be a normal hour and 45 minute flight now takes six (6) and a half hours!  [Welcome to my world.]

GRAND CANYON

Okay oKay.  Now what mitigated these circumstances a bit was the fact that we flew RIGHT OVER the Grand Canyon and we got to see a lot of the beauty and expansive reach of this wonder of nature.

Take a look at the pictures and get you sense of the feel I had fun seeing it.

I'm a fan of Southwest on the bases of their on-time scores, low lost luggage rates, I-can-do-it staff attitude, and overall cost.  The queue system for seating doesn't bother me and I find it worth the Early Bird fee to get on a bit sooner.  The math is that it's a very effective way to administer a variable demand system.

My only knock is that after many flights with no delays, I've seen three delays on recent trips.  We ended up making up some time in the air on two of those flights, which is cool.  Just hoping it's not a pattern."

Yes, it really is that hypocritical. Pay more and get more points. Find and use low fares at the ""low fare"" airline and you are penalized severely. The current frequent flyer program is worthless. Programs like that are a real motivator to me and many other frequent flyers. We are not going to pay more to deceive ourselves into thinking we are getting something ""free.""  Nor are we going to rip off our companies by intentionally paying higher fares just to qualify for perks we used to earn by virtue of flying all the time with SWA. They've completely alienated me.

But, the poor 2 people behind the US Air counter were obviously over-stretched.  Even one more person on the desk would have made things run a little smoother. 

We were only slightly delayed. No big deal. It happens, particularly when it's snowing all across the land.  The weird thing, though, was the total confusion from the people at the gate desk about which place (Philly or DC) would board first. I should have known that this was a bad sign. 

We got to DC only a 1/2 hr. late.  Not bad for holiday travel. However, nobody's luggage arrived.  Now, 7+ hours later, we still can't get any update on if our bags have been located.  Here's the thing -- I'd be more patient if we hadn't PAID to check the dang bags.  But if you pay to check 'em, and the airline manages to misplace a whole PLANE worth of luggage, I feel like I should get a refund on that $30 luggage fee.

2009-06-17,US Airways,dcBke_M92rRu1_gqLkFyGw,4,"I mentioned in a review of Southwest my outlook and understanding of the airline industry, which I will not repeat now. But to recap, there are generic problems with air travel, the airport process and the airline industry in general that is unfair to an airline to use as a standard, including lines, security, crowds, delays, etc.

As for US Airways, I can't say I have many complaints from the consumer perspective. For non-stop options out of Phoenix, your best bets are Southwest and US Airways, unless your destination is a hub of another airline, i.e. Dallas and Chicago for American; Denver, San Francisco, Washington and Chicago for United; Salt Lake City, Atlanta, JFK and Cincinnati on Delta, etc. With Phoenix as a hub for US Airways and Southwest (though the latter insists it's a ""focus city"") the former offers a large number of non-stop options from Sky Harbor. 

The seats are about average for American carriers, they have rescinded charges for in-flight beverages and they are great about getting out on time. Last time I flew with them I went to San Francisco. The flight into Phoenix was running late, which would have put me in the City by the Bay an hour later than I was scheduled. Anyone who has tried to change an itinerary before knows that most airlines charge hefty penalties to do so. However, the check-in agent let me switch to Oakland at no charge, getting me in earlier than I expected. 

Yes, US Airways has its downsides as well, but I must admit they're mostly on the back-end of things. It would be nice if they would expand international service out of Phoenix, giving us non-stop options into Europe, Asia, South America, maybe even Australia, as Phoenix is easily within a large aircraft's range of all three continents. From a local perspective, it's bad they instead focus more on their Eastern hubs of Charlotte and Philadelphia, as they will expand to Brazil and China within the next year, though only those two cities will benefit. From a civic standpoint, it could benefit the city and area to expand Phoenix' options, especially considering that many cities smaller than Phoenix offer more international destinations including Portland, Salt Lake City and Charlotte. 

I'll admit Sky Harbor will be lacking for some time until this recession relents to a bull market... maybe. But in sum, US Airways' tickets are pretty reasonable, often cheaper than other carriers. Out of Sky Harbor, Southwest is its biggest competition and I would gladly pay a little more to fly US Airways domestically than I would Southwest."
2009-09-01,US Airways,3f1NstySzvoKDjyy78UGOQ,1,"Dear US Airways,

For those of us who don't have the money to spoil ourselves on first class and economy, you really make us hate flying.

As if wasn't annoying enough to go through check-in lines, security lines, take off your shoes, laptop, jacket, liquids and the typical crappy-expensive airport food, getting on your plane still makes it worst than everything else.

Lets start with the fact that you cheap out on your customers. No food, no snacks, minimum drinks, disgruntle service. Lets add to that the fact that more than 4 times you have told me that the flight will be delayed (time unknown) because you had to ""check the engines"". Really? really? You need to CHECK THE ENGINE? is it to see that you won't kills us? It seems that you're the only airlines that has the need to do this, and to not let me know until WHEN you are delaying the flight but instead tell me that we should ""check back"" in 15-30mins.

Lets continue with the fact that added to these delays, you delayed one of my flights almost 3 hours (in 30 min intervals, of course, so we never really knew until when the delay was) AND that once  you told me that the engine had failed, you made me wait again until you got another plane, and then wait even more because you ""have the plane but not a gate for it"". Added to this is the fact that I spent the midnight of my 21st bday at the freaking houston airport and didn't get home until 5am on a monday when I had class at 9am insetad of arriving at the original time of 12am.

I get that you are trying to be cheap to keep your prices low... but maybe you should reduce your costs by being more efficient instead of skimping out on your customer service."
2009-09-04,US Airways,9hje_tww4fP-j4GZeWmNpA,2,"US Airways used to be right up there w/Continental.. now they're down there

I didn't even mind the fact that they started charging for their food.. 

But now they're going overboard.. 

I didn't want to bring a heavy jacket w/me to Cabo, so I wore a light jacket and I figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice.  I noticed there weren't any blankets on board and when I asked a flight attendant for one he said "".......yea.. for $7"" I almost started laughing cause I thought he was trying to crack a joke.   He wasn't.  

Introducing US Airways' ""nap pack"" comes w/crappy blanket, ear plugs, inflatable neck rest , for only $7!  Use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities!  

So I decline.. and they must crank the A/C up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack.. cause the tip of my nose was cold and I just couldn't sleep at all during my flight w hile I was trying cover every surface of my body w/my stretched out light jacket.

And you also suck cause you run out of your purchased meals...who doesn't pack enough for the flight?  You suck at even saving money for yourselves.."
2009-10-17,US Airways,nEMmc4ZN0AWoXanqKj6sDw,1,"I realized just the other day that I never updated this review.  Sadly, US Air still gets one star. 

After months of waiting, filling out paperwork, and jumping through annoying hoops. we got reimbursed for less than 1/3 of what was lost. Not to mention that the biggest things lost were hand-made Christmas gifts.  We've learned our lesson about checking baggage... and about US Air. 

After such a fiasco, I won't be flying US Air again if I ever have the choice.  If I have to fly on their airline, everything will be either shipped ahead or carry on.  Ack!"
2009-12-24,US Airways,1NnRrhYlC0AhN0ITi66A7Q,1,"Well...these days it is difficult to find anything positive to report about an airline. US Airways delivers nuts and bolts in an average way (meaning the plane works technically and delivers you to your destination for a reasonable price). Mostly on time. 

They could stand out from this averageness, however, if they would not make so many Nickeling and Diming efforts. For example the seat selling techniques applied are just downright counterproductive. When checking in on line, all seats except the pre-assigned center seats (different rows, even though we bought tickets together) were $15. This, of course, to compel you to spend another $30 to sit with The Wife (yes, $30, since there was no purchaseable seat right next to one of the pre-assigned centers....psychology, anyone??). Then, we were almost late at the airport, but still went to the underused check-in counter. We asked if we could sit together. Result: Reclining exit row seats for free in a half-full plane.

Then we proceeded through the half empty airport and found out that we could actually go on a 1hr earlier plane, which was not full. However, the representative at the gate wanted $50 per ticked to make this change...again the Nickel and the Dime! Do they realize how bad this looks? Letting us on would not have cost anything, but would have left us with a happy memory...corporate numb nuts! Anyway, we went for coffee, saved the $100, and went on the booked plane. Can't be Nickeled and Dimed!

More from the US Airways front (6/2011). It appears that they are stepping up their ""force people to check bags to collect more revenue"" efforts. Sitting at the gate, the loudspeaker blasted something like: ""If your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now, but wait until we detect your outsize-baggage-sneaking-in attempts at the gate when boarding, you will be charged for the bag when we check it in""-very nice. Several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags (for free). Then, when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the ""sizer"". It was slightly too thick, and the clerkess immediately blasted: this must be checked...but then she got distracted, and another less-eager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane...lucky me!

Bottom line: It ain't getting better in those 'friendly skies'! Fly Southwest if you can!"
2010-01-04,US Airways,krXM21qnQ4RbQOjYLohZYA,1,"Worst customer service, worst unaccompanied minor, garbage airlines. My daughter whom is 13 has been traveling unaccompanied for 2 years on other airlines as the cutoff age is 11 for Southwest, United, etc. At the Roanoke airport they said she could fly by herself and let her on. On the stop over they wouldn't let her on the plane unless we paid $100 but my wife said at the Roanoke airport the said she could fly alone. They made a big deal but had no choice but to let her continue the trip. On the website I kept on checking every minute on arrival status. It said she was arriving half hour late. She in fact she arrived half hour early. On the way back at Houston I went to check her in and they said that the flight had been canceled and tried to blame me for checking her in during the 24 hour check in time. I got no phone call or email despite they having phone and email information that I was required to give them. Then they said she can't fly anyway because she is under 15. So they said get a refund on the ticket. They wouldn't let her fly on Delta airline even if I paid the unaccompanied minor fee. I immediately called Southwest Air and she got on the plane no problem and no fee for unaccompanied minor and their age cutoff is 11 like most airlines. I have flown Southwest many times and she has flown Southwest many times without problems and the fare is cheaper but I couldn't get the flight in the exact location so that is why I chose US Air, but never again as this has been my worst airline nightmare in my whole life. With customer service like that you would wonder how they are saving cost on maintenance of their airlines. This airline is not safe to fly from what I've seen. I am willing to pay higher price for any other airlines that is safer and better customer service."
2010-01-19,US Airways,3EWJz2XAiFELIVLQHgSvXQ,1,"I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.

US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.
Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.
I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.
Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying ""Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright.""
Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life."

Two days later, found a new flight for a week & 1/2 later. Called to use the voucher and was told there would be $150 change fee on top of the NEW much lower airfare. Hmmm...

After multiple discussions with various agents, was told that tho' there was a ticket for $175 less than the voucher, which I was looking at online at the moment, and I wanted to use the voucher for the amount PLUS the ridiculous change fee, which would leave me still paying another $25 (remember, I already paid $250 for the ticket I had to cancel), I was not allowed! Period. No discussion. Too bad. 

WHY? Because the actual ticket price had to be equal to or more than the original ticket, plus pay the change fee. EVIL"

Also, if you accept our reservation, at least check us in at your desk - rude lady at the counter in SJ almost got joy from telling us we had to get back on to the bus (with our 5 bags - which by the way they charged us $110 for there, and $195 for back) and head to sorry ass Terminal C.

To make things worse, in Phoenix, the wait to check in was over an hour and a half.  Got to the airport 2 hours and 15 minutes before our flight and because of US Airways total crap service we boarded our plane with only 10 minutes to spare.

And while this not their fault - but because you've been stressed and miserable dealing with the idiots inside the airport - you are just destined for two bumpy ass flights while in the sky.

The unfortunate thing about air travel is that basically the rules that airlines have to go by can really suck.  It almost cripples the employees from giving what a person would traditionally deem as ""good service.""

That said . . . 

I find that US Airways always provides me with a predictable, safe, peaceful experience on par with most all major airlines.

I've yet to have any major problems as a US Airways passenger."
2010-04-19,US Airways,ZXkoMpiVF1C2J_zoTLHQEA,2,"US Airways is like two different airlines. If you're an elite member you get good US Airways, otherwise you get bad US Airways. I travel a lot for work....not exactly a badge of honor but, whatever...and I have to say that when you reach that level a whole new world of service opens up to you. One of the things they do that I like is the policy of automatic upgrades, based on availability. Other airlines want you to fiddle around with coupons and such. These guys just give you a seat. Simple and efficient...works for me :-)

To me airlines are sort of like cell phone providers. They all suck, some just suck a little less than others. With the hub-and-spoke system the airlines have created more or less a monopoly. If you live in Phoenix the only viable options are US Air and Southwest. Sure, there are other airlines but you'll be faced with connections and poor schedules so pick your poison. 

ALL airlines experience delays and they ALL lie about the reason for the delay. When they say it's a 15 minute delay it really means an hour. They intentionally oversell flights in the hope that someone will cancel. Unlike the hotel elite programs, your miles WILL expire if you're not careful and don't expect to get a courtesy note either. 

Why the rant? It's only to illustrate that all airlines are the same. US Airways is no better or no worse than any of the others. 

I will say this for them though, their frequent flyer perks are fairly good and relatively easy to reach. Once you get to Gold or Platinum the upgrades are pretty regular. Just being able to use the first class check-in line at the airport is nice, even if you don't get a first class seat that day. 

So yeah, it's not perfect but it's better than some. And that's about as close and I'm going to get to a compliment for any airline :-)"

I am also a pilot (20) years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well!  This rant is not about operations, security or delays.

I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte.  The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight!  This old, cranky b#$%^ came by and said, ""what do you want?""  I said I would like to have a soda and a water.  She said you can only have one or the other.  I was so thirsty I asked for the water.  It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refill...please!  She said, ""I told you that you could only have one""  and pushed the cart away.

Normally I fly southwest - for some odd reason US airways this past time was the better deal. NEVER AGAIN!

I like to consider myself not much of a complainer (see other reviews) but my flight out of PHX to LAS VEGAS was horrendous.

Allow me to clarify. Not the flight itself but the plane. I might as well have been on a private jet. I think if I stretched my body from fingertips to toes I would make up the width of the plane... I'm 5'1.... Another down side was that they charge for checked baggage - needless to say I was not going to pay the extra fee and thus consolidated all my belongings into a small 'approved' suitcase, only to come to find out that it wouldn't fit in the overhead storage.

Talk about GHETTO!  The first plane was so old that the seats were all sunken in and worn out.  There was no cushion to the cushion.  I might as well have been sitting on the chair frame alone.  There is no way that seat cushion could have kept us afloat if we landed in water.  And it was a 3.5 hour flight!  

In addition to terrible seats, they didn't provide any complimentary (which isn't really complimentary because you paid for the flight) snacks on the flight.  You had to pay for snacks, even a small pack of peanuts!  What the heck?!  Even on the 6 hour flight from Phoenix to Maui they only provided beverages, no snacks.  Talk about cheap!  

To top off our whole US Airways experience, they made us check in our carry-on luggage in Kauai because they said the overhead compartments were full.  So we checked in our luggage, walked to our seat, and found plenty of space right above our seats for our carry-ons.  Then we had to wait an hour at baggage claim to get our carry-ons.  Ugh!  

Never again, US Airways!!!"

I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.

So, I kept the ticket as it was and purchased a new, additional one-way ticket for just my mom so she could get here early and then my stepdad would fly out a day later on the original ticket. All was good until it was time to check them in for their return flight back to LA. My mom's original return flight wasn't coming up on the computer. I called US Airways and they said since she didn't travel on her original flight out, that she unknowingly forfeited her return flight as well. After utter shock and anger, they made me buy another last minute, full-priced ticket to get her home today. So to sum it up they received twice the money from us, and then received money from another passenger for using my mom's original seat. Does this sound unreasonable to anyone else?

Probably trickles down to the passengers who are rude to one another.  Too high priced in comparison to Southwest who has bigger seats, friendly employees, friendly passengers and amenities.  You cannot tell me Southwest can charge cheaper rates and give more and better service for almost twice as less US AIR charges for all the attitude and lack of service.

US Airways Flight 4427
Philadelphia to Baltimore
August 8th, 2013
Flight Cancelled

I was not late to my flight, I did not miss the date, I did everything correct. It was -your- airline that created the entire problem by overbooking all flights that came after our cancelled flight that day. The only resolution offered to us that would fly us directly to Baltimore would have been to take a flight leaving -11 HOURS- (9pm) after our originally scheduled flight (11am). That is not acceptable.

This was the answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt:

""When a customer accepts accommodations to an alternate airport, the customer assumes responsibility for the additional expenses.""

To note here, we did not ""assume"" the extra expenses. We were given no other choice if we wanted to reach Baltimore in time. We accepted a flight to DC because it was our only alternative that would get us close enough to take public transportation to Baltimore, and to meet our deadline.

I did ask if we could be provided a rental car so we could drive ourselves from Philadelphia, and that request was immediately denied. As it was, we had to spend our own money for all public transportation from DC to Baltimore so we could meet our group waiting for us in time. This is also not acceptable. It took us FOUR trains to get from DC to Baltimore in unfamiliar territory. Why should this cost be on us?

This was a second answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt:

""There are no federal aviation regulations concerning what an airline must do to compensate passengers when the carrier delays or cancels a flight. This is true regardless of the reason for the delay/cancellation (e.g., weather, mechanical, crew availability, etc.).""

So basically because it is not ILLEGAL, they are not required to help their customers in any way. Beware if you are flying US Airways in the future, I would consider otherwise. I have flown on other airlines and I have always either been provided a hotel, food, direct compensation for a future flight or alternate transportation to my exact destination at no cost to myself.

Keeping the money we paid for services you did not deliver upon is considered theft. Your airline is a poor excuse for a business, and we will never fly with you again.

Sincerely,

Anne K."

And we still have to send in the receipts and a form to get that back. Overall one of the worst experiences I've ever had.

I'm not going to go into details but let me give you a few adjectives: RUDE, BITTER, CARELESS.... I don't see how one business seemed to hire only employees who seem to hate life and seem to allow them to get away with it. Where is common respect for your customers US Airways? I sure hope you can take some learnings from American Airlines."
2014-03-28,US Airways,9wqwrO1VbOGmgix4D5Ol7g,2,They seem to have sacrificed customer service completely. You have to check in at a kiosk pay $25.00 for the baggage fee .

I booked my parents together in international first class 3 months before their flight only to find their ""computer"" reassigned them separate seats a few days before and ""nothing we can do"" was the answer from 3 levels of escalation. Don't waste your money, these idiots don't care and when I used to travel them personally for business they were THE worst. I'll take multiple inconvenient legs on any other airline just to avoid these tools. PLEASE PLEASE AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2008-01-28,Southwest Airlines,wYDUILe0QJpb-t62OqEYOw,1,"Hey Southwest:

It's no surprise why people whisper behind your back, calling you ""SouthWORST."" It's no surprise why, when asked, your unfortunate patrons say they feel miserable whenever they fly on your airline. It's true. You make people miserable - with your strange and stupid delays, your cattle-call boarding, your small seats with no leg room and your rude, obnoxious employees. 

To your surprise, it does, indeed, sometimes rain in Phoenix (and even Las Vegas, for that matter). Sometimes with rain, comes fog and low visibility. I think you should have learned that in 3rd grade science. In any case, whenever it rains, you, SouthWORST, forget flying fundamentals - perhaps like an actor with stage fright - and simply refuse to perform. 

It's true; you make people miserable. You make them wait in other cramped airports for four to six hours (maybe longer), just hoping to soon be boarding, just hoping there's not an excruciating wait on the tar mat or that their checked bag(s) won't end up in Bangladesh.

They say misery likes company. I believe you hate yourself, SouthWORST. I would, too, if I were you. So, in hating yourself, you hate others. You bully them, take their money, make them wait, cackle when you know they're hungry, tired and in need of some deodorant and a breath mint. You're miserable, SouthWORST, and you make me miserable, too. 

Disregards, 
Alicia"
2008-06-18,Southwest Airlines,K8Z4FlIR66WoVut_WJHY6w,5,"I am faithful and loyal. Simply give me personal service and a good deal, and I am yours forever.

The fact that someone answers the phone when you call is a gift in itself. Airline travel is never going to be perfect or seamless, but I am inspired by this company who keeps a friendly attitude for the most part and a good sense of humor. 

I do get a good laugh out of the A/B/C lines and people camping out to make sure they get on first. I was thrilled to hear about the change in boarding and that now, people with kids have to actually suffer with the rest of us.

Now if only JetBlue would make a direct flight to the Bay... there would be a strong competitor for my cheap ass!"
2008-06-19,Southwest Airlines,anscMI06B37oaxo44-0dAA,2,"I don't mind the cattle call or the delays or the crappy seats, I don't - it's Southwest, you know that going in - you're gonna get what you paid for. It's the service, or lack thereof, that kills me. Southwest employees are so unprofessional, they're teen-age kids at home alone when their parents are in Europe for a month - inviting all their friends over, trashing the house, breaking into the liquor cabinet... Seriously, I think the flight attendant on my last flight was drunk. You should have heard her little safety announcement/orientation speech. Here's an excerpt (you'll have to imagine her intermittent hiccups and giggles yourself): 'The light button over your seat will turn on your light. The flight attendant button, on the other hand, will not turn on your flight attendant.' Amusing? Sure. Did the attitude instill a sense of confidence that an emergency situation would be handled quickly & efficiently? Hell no."
2008-06-19,Southwest Airlines,yiB5T3Kjm2LtCzYFKykI5Q,4,"I like southwest. I fly them for business a lot - especially to California and other nearby states, though I've flown them to the east coast, too. 

I don't care about unassigned seating. I always get an aisle seat. Just check in 24 hours early! Most people don't. You can even check in, not have a printer, then just pick up a boarding pass from the machine at the airport. I do that a lot for my return travel. 

Their frequent flyer program is good, I fly on southwest for free, a LOT. I just earned another ticket this week. I think it's my 5th! I also get free drink coupons in the mail from them. I never use them all, and so on a flight I'll be on right before they expire, I'll bring all I have with me and be mr. popular in the area I'm sitting, because I got the other nearby passengers free drinks.

Anyway, what do you expect? All airlines are more or less the same. If you're going to want something to eat or drink on the plane, just pack it with you. Then you can have exactly what you want. 

Southwest is a low priced carrier, but the seats are comfortable and the planes are clean. I mean, I get on the plane, sit in a chair for a few hours, and get off. I don't have too high of an expectation in terms of needing hosts/hostesses to fawn over you or smile or whatever. I just want to get there with my luggage, on time. They generally do that, are usually among the most reasonably priced, and their freq flyer program is great.  So I giver them a high rating!

About their freq flyer thing - when I book my hotel and rental car with it too, I can still use all my normal discount codes etc from membership in whatever, but also double dip on points!!! So - for example - I get say - Hilton points, Hertz points, AND Southwest miles - for booking it through the Southwest site. And the same price as booking directly. I don't know why Southwest doesn't advertise this? With the double dipping and frequent travel, I have been collecting points FAST since I figured this out recently.

Next personal trip - SF!"
2008-07-06,Southwest Airlines,Pf_Vni8bb4A-r8oNQy3TkA,4,"I don't know why they changed the boarding system recently, but I like it. Having small children will no longer get you ahead of my A boarding pass. Good. You can check in early like everyone else if you want a decent seat.

Now if only the stewardesses would give up the whole can of Coke without me having to beg for it..."
2008-07-25,Southwest Airlines,VJXvm41mPkBls0Z8_XNFoQ,3,"After a surprisingly pleasant Southwest customer experience, I've decided to give them another star...

So I arrived at the Austin airport two hours early for my flight back to Phoenix (am I the only one that still arrives this early?), only to discover that my flight's been delayed two hours (I'd been camping for a few days out at Enchanted Rock without means of checking their website before we headed out). So I'm depressed, staring down the barrel of 9 more hours before I get home (4 for the airport wait / 5 for the flight - yeah, I bought the cheapest ticket possible, w/ 2 stops).

As I'm heading for Security, I spot another flight on the monitor, this one leaving in half an hour. I march directly to the gate counter; there's a long line, but it's moving at a very efficient pace. Once up front just a couple of minutes later, I'm greeted with a big smile (I know - right! Wasn't expecting that!) Flight's pretty full and there's already a few folks on the wait list, but she'll see what she can do. She warned me she wouldn't know until last minute, but was kind enough to check in with me several times while I waited, making sure I knew she hadn't forgotten about me. And lo and behold, she came through for me. Last minute, just before they closed the doors, but I was on that plane, no ticket switching charge, in a window seat no less, and to top it off, it was direct - only 2 hours long. Thank you Southwest lady! Not for just doing your job but being so darn nice about it.

Oh yeah, did get another choice quote from a flight attendant as we came in for landing:
""Thank you for flying Southwest. Your flight today was sponsored by: Sally's House of Plaid, where if you're sad, it's time to wear plaid... And Little Johnny's Sewer Service, where your number two is our number one."" WTF?"
2009-04-29,Southwest Airlines,X-SDNlwco6qqxlp_-e-3OA,5,"I love Southwest. So much so that I should buy stock.

Aside from the fact that I never have time to finish my adult beverage on the way to Vegas before we descend, there is absolutely nothing to complain about.

Cheap, quick and easy. Just the way I like my men."
2009-05-09,Southwest Airlines,fT1AxqllCWoRq9q10nw6Ew,1,"Moooo.  Like cattle, we line up to go through the line and get on the plane.  In the past, there was mauling and gnashing of teeth to see who could be at the front of the 'A' line, and then a senior citizen or parent with 4 kids would snag the exit row because they were allowed to pre-board (even though legally they're not supposed to sit in the exit row if they're so old that they need extra time to get a seat, or if a parent watching kids).  My only consolation is seeing how irate the families get now that their precious ""family boarding"" is after the 'A' group, making them have to push and shove with the rest of us, and fight to the death for precious overhead space.

We don't have a fist-fight at the front of the 'A' line any longer.  Instead, there are a bunch of pathetic people who sit in front of their computer and wait until exactly 24 hours before the flight to log on and claim their 'A' boarding pass.  What is amusing is that I tried this once, at exactly the 24 hour limit, and yet I'm somehow #33 in the 'A' group.  Way to go Southwest - eliminate once crazy line and create another.

Stewards and Stewardesses are dressed casual, make jokes that are marginally funny at best, and have ruined air travel for the rest of us on other airlines because so many people are accustomed to behaving and dressing however they want on a flight.  Oh God, bring back the days when air travel was a luxury, and the bus people took the bus (or Amtrak, for that matter).  

Southwest is truly the Wal-Mart of airlines, and has impacted the air travel industry negatively for who knows how long."
2009-05-28,Southwest Airlines,RD8azxi9CFNHGK5Q5vgDWQ,2,"As someone who has had working experience in the airline industry on the scheduling and pricing end, I feel I can't gripe about the usual boohoos everyone else has about the airline industry. To clear up a few things to express my point: 

-Long lines: this is a part of going to the airport. Get over it or deal with the several-times-longer method of surface transit
-Delays: this is another part of the airport experience. So what if it's sunny and gorgeous outside. Your flight began in Atlanta, where there are thunderstorms and tornadoes. 
-Cranky people: air travel may not be as easy as you think. In the year 2009, the questions people still ask surprise me. *Fun Fact: Did you know an E-ticket is exactly that? An ELECTRONIC ticket. Yeah, you can book travel and go to the airport with nothing but your government-issued ID and you'll get a boarding pass. You REALLY don't need anything else. Little kinks in the grand system and little things happening in people's lives can make them a bit cranky
-Uncomfortable seats: airplanes are metal tubes run by people who want to cram as many people in as possible in order to make a profit. This is a capitalist society and that's just part of it. Lower-quality seats are cheaper to purchase than plush velvet.

That and more make up the curse of air travel. Now, I will focus specifically on Southwest. They are a ""closet hub-and-spoke"" airline, as in they consider themselves point-to-point. I will admit that they do offer a fair selection of some point-to-point routes. However like all airlines they have hubs and focus cities, Phoenix being one of their hubs. This means that it is likely that if you live here, or visit here frequently, you will use it for a domestic flight. They are decent for Vegas or Southern California cities, but aren't a great option for many large cities east of Arizona, especially those with two or more commercial airports, as they typically service the most inconvenient ones for vacations, such as BWI, Dallas Love, Chicago Midway or MacArthur Islip on Long Island. 

Their flight attendants remind me of preschool teachers and it seems they get end-of-the-year bonuses for acting like clowns. They're nice and friendly, but a bit overly perky and bubbly. The unassigned seating is a fiasco and this airline more than any other American carrier seems to be the de facto family carrier. I haven't been on any other carrier that attracts as many children, and I've been on a long list from American to Continental, from Cathay Pacific to Thai, from Asiana to AirFrance. Southwest  does offer competitive rates, but you will get what you pay for, including a flying day care and mystery seat. The whole A,B,C boarding process is ridiculous, as you really have no say in where you sit. For a weekend trip to Vegas or Southern California, from Phoenix, your options are US Airways, Southwest or United Express (LAX only) and in my opinion, unless Southwest offered an unbeatable deal, I would pay a little more to take either of the other two.

I could prattle on about specific experiences, though those could happen on any airline. In short, the structure and policies of Southwest are its weakest points. I will say that it isn't the worst airline I've ever been on (Aeroflot is the absolute worst and most likely will always be the absolute worst) but I would definitely look at other options, even choosing a layover on a different carrier though Southwest might offer a non-stop option. As I said before, I would fly it again, but only if the difference in fare between it and its competition was significantly lower."
2009-06-16,Southwest Airlines,Wldy7UDxa5WL4Ki--bX88g,4,"I really like Southwest Airlines.  While not fancy, they do exactly what they are supposed to do -  get you where you are going safely and efficiently - with your luggage!

- Great customer service as well as friendly staff and crew

- Inexpensive flights with frequent time slots to choose from, as well as super easy online check-in

- No charge for two - count 'em TWO checked bags.  Yep, I can shop as much as I want at my destination and still drag it all home

- OK, parents will not like me for this one - families with children are not given priority boarding before everyone, but are slotted between the A and B boarding groups.  There are still plenty of seats to be had for you large family types, but those of us without children are not penalized. 

- Wise-cracking flight attendants.  My favorite was on a flight to Vegas.  When it was time to collect the service items prior to landing the attendant on the speaker said ""OK people, pass all your cups and glasses to the aisle - we are not going to fly around all day so you can drink""  Hahaha!"
2009-06-23,Southwest Airlines,HevVsp4bXL6mK0WL9HTciA,2,"I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  I take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, I'm wrong, how stupid I am.  I must be thinking of my library card.    Why are things so difficult sometimes?"
2009-08-24,Southwest Airlines,sk1aVST7LtJMCNimYJorYA,3,"While our whole family has been using Southwest for around 30 years, and have obviously been pleased, getting stuck here in Phoenix for 6 hours was certainly out of the norm...  A friend and I were coming back from a convention in Los Angeles and hand carrying about 200 pounds of laptops, computers and audio and video recording equipment that we just didn't care to check (have handled with other luggage).   I know we were pushing the limit of carry on weight and if we had had any idea what was going to happen we would not have even thought of carrying that much weight. 

What ended up happening, we still don't quite know.  We suspect there was something wrong with the plane that we were supposed to be getting on to get back to Texas.   It either wasn't there, or they grounded it or something and we were told that our plane was coming from NEW YORK and it was going to take a ""few hours"".   We were like, WTF!?   WHY, would they send a plane from New York almost to California and Mexico to take us back home to Southeast Texas???  

They were not joking.   It took about 4.5 hours for our plane to arrive.   It really did come from New York, empty, to take us home.   Now to Southwests credit, they fed us.   They ordered like 75-80 large pizzas from Domino's whom delivered them to us.   So we got to eat and chit chat with people from all over the world, take some naps on the floor and basically live there in the terminal for a large slice of our day.   

Here's my major gripe.   After all of this, and having boarding group A, we were just ready to get on the damn plane and get home.  My friend's wife was wondering what in the world was going on, we were both getting irritable and what happens?   A group of 17 people (yes we counted them) obviously from another country where courtesy and honesty must not exist, all pre-boarded to accompany a SINGLE child that was like 6-7 years old!    NO KIDDING!    I mean, what kind of BS is that?  

When we finally left out, it was well after the airport had closed and SW had to get special clearance from the FAA to leave at 2:30am since it was after noise regulation time.   We got the clearance, pilot said he was going to push it, got up to 47,000 feet and hauled ass way above and across Texas and back to Houston.  The pilot was able to cut 35 minutes off the normal flight time and we were going so fast that the nose of the plane was up higher than normal.     I have read that a 737 is capable of breaking the sound barrier (768 mph) and while I am sure a commercial pilot would not do something like that, I actually asked the stewardess how fast we were going.  She went and asked the pilot and she came back with the answer.   ""About 700 mph.""   That was the fastest I have ever gone in a 737 before.

This was a very unusual experience to have with Southwest, and aside from the 17 people boarding with one child, I like how they handled the situation.   I'd still be interested to know what happened to the plane that was supposed to be there for us when we came from Los Angeles, but they didn't have much information other than the fact that it might have been a safety issue....    Stuff happens.  I still like Southwest and use them all the time."
2009-08-26,Southwest Airlines,9fF8yJRz4PRW8qEaWKF_nw,5,"Southwest just kicks ass.  They always have amazingly cheap flight specials, are on time, and their crew rocks.

Luckily Southwest has provided me with the wonderful opportunity to enjoy my favorite past time.  The flights are always ridiculously cheap, I swear the employees are high off of something because they are always happy, and I think the pilots are speeding (my flight always arrives 15 minutes early!).  All planes are pretty much the same, and Southwest goes out of there way to make a little more enjoyable at the cheapest cost.  Unless I am going international, Southwest is my go to airline!"

2010-11-28,Southwest Airlines,EzNHGSLhI9athwZTeos4Tg,5,"I have flown on Southwest Airlines virtually every week since 2002. For 5 years I was flying SWA out of ABQ and for the past 8 years I have been flying SWA out of PHX.  The best thing about SWA is their people... They actually seem to care about their customers, especially in comparison to any other airline I have flown... And, I have flown on every domestic carrier! There have been several instances where this genuine concern became very apparent to this high mileage road warrior. I fly enough to have both A-List and the Free Companion Card. Once when an emergency came up, my wife had to return from PVD the day before I could return, after much consternation, a manager was brought to the ticket counter at the T. F. Green Airport in PVD and he went ahead and issued a ticket to my wife at No Charge, despite the fact that I was not going to take the same flight until the next day... Hooray for that manager in PVD! He did the right thing despite violating company policy.  

For people like me who travel on business as part of their regular weekly job duties, the fact that SWA does not penalize their fliers for changing tickets at the last minute is the most truly distinguishing official policy difference with other airlines.  There have been many times I have arrived to the airport several hours earlier than planned due to finishing work in less time than originally estimated.  If there are seats available on an earlier flight home, no problem, SWA will put you on the earlier flight without a $150 change fee like other airlines.  This is great, and it works when you are late as well!  

Despite being a former US Airways Chairman Preferred snob who swore he would never fly on the ""Southwest Bus"", SWA has become my carrier of preference to the point where I will fly into an airport further away from my local destination, so I can fly on Southwest instead of any of the other ""We Hate Our Passengers"" airlines!

I was able to find $59 fares from Phoenix to Denver and $59 on the way back. The way back was the day before Thanksgiving, the busiest travel day, we were amazed that they even offered it considering everything goes up in price to make more money off this holiday.

The best thing about them is what they don't do. Bag fees. That's one thing that really grinds my gears. So thank you southwest."

oh yeah, My huge beef with this airline is how careless the baggage handlers are, I've watched them unload peoples bags from their little carts they drive around the tarmac on, and those guys act as if they're lobbing piles of garbage off a dump truck. I have, no had, a vintage WWII rucksack my uncle gave me for christmas one year that I used to use for all my travels. It was sturdy and had survived a fucking world war for christ sake! well once the careless monkeys SW employs to handle their customers baggage got their mits on it, it returned to me from the baggage carousel with two of its leather straps broken, and some articles missing. giant WTF moment for me, minor incident for them. no scratch that, it isnt an incident if you cant even get an apology out of a single one of their employees.

2011-08-13,Southwest Airlines,IULns4qtdYg9tf5jtySFKQ,4,"i wish all airlines have no change fees!

i love the positive attitude of the flight crew!

tip: sit in the exit row and be willing to help in the event of the emergency! 

gals: don't wear flip flops or 5 inch heels on a flight. i have seen this too many times and i wonder what would happen if they have tripped running for an exit!"
2011-12-25,Southwest Airlines,23K_F9_k9LaWI44jw31qDA,5,"Man, I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!"
2012-01-11,Southwest Airlines,jNjOslzT82U-N6Nmnr3w-g,5,"I LOVE southwest!!  One of the only remaining airlines in the states that gives you free snacks and drinks for your flight.  Attendants look like they actually like their jobs, and also look under the age of 35, which is a rarity these days.

I love the comedic safety info, as it really gets you to listen.  The seats aren't the most comfortable, but the flights aren't actually that long, so I was fine.

I actually love the no seating assignment rule, too.  You are still, to a degree, getting to choose who you sit next to/where on the plane you sit.  I personally tried to avoid people with babies (sorry, I like to sleep).

One thing I'm dying to know, though, is why southwest passengers take longer ton disembark from the plane than any other airline?? Hurry up, people!"
2012-01-17,Southwest Airlines,RFUY5AOvID-HrgzTZeLzDA,4,"B28.  Sounds like bingo but it was my position in line to get on the plane home.  Ok I am not crazy about standing in line and hoping to get an aisle or window but once on the plane the crew made for a fun trip.  I had plenty of room for my knees and the peanuts helped a few minutes pass.

I do think most people know they have to check in 24 hours prior to flight.  If  not they get C on their boarding pass which really means middle seat. This is ok if your traveling with someone you know.  This is my choice of airlines if possible."
2012-02-11,Southwest Airlines,zR0f6ojWRvzZPpm-92l5vg,4,"I have been flying somewhere for business or pleasure just about every week for 15 years... Most airlines operate on the basis of despising their passengers. Southwest is unique in that their employees are happy to work there, and seem to genuinely like their passengers.  After being a ""Platinum"" and ""Chairman Preferred"" frequent flyer on other airlines, with First Class upgrades and overcrowded VIP lounges, I am now doing 90% of my travel on Southwest because they simply do a better job of consistently getting me to my destination, on time, while treating me like a true friend along the way.  I tell many other travelers that I choose Southwest Airlines because they take all the drama out of air travel!"
2012-02-19,Southwest Airlines,ZkG-spy-wd0YXN06rxcMcg,4,"Southwest is Southwest but what stands out now is that they finally offer internet in flight. It's $5 and worth it but the connection can be very, very slow. My advice is only buy it if you need to work on the flight but be warned the connection might be slow. But hey, we are thousands of feet in the air so it can't be a huge surprise it's slow."
2012-02-27,Southwest Airlines,pFTBKDuRYcBoHOsQthiKWg,4,"I used to hate this airline, but you know what. When you want to hop over to LA or Vegas from PHX, their internet fares and getaway fares are awesome. It really is like a bus in the sky, but if you make sure to check in online - and only book short flights - this is a perfect solution.

When I want to pop down to Los Angeles to see family or go to events or jump over the Vegas for a weekend, this really makes sense."
2012-03-20,Southwest Airlines,JH1HNvhnAU3JnyUi5xFb7Q,1,"I'm disappointed that I left SJ, CA without any problems. But leaving Phoenix AZ I was charged 50 dollars for my luggage be 4 pounds over weight.  I left AZ with exactly what I left home with if not less.  Thanks for nothing Southwest. This is totally BS"
2012-04-02,Southwest Airlines,M8rAcpLdtgwmKunv10lgvg,4,"Great for business short hops. I'm not sure I could go much more than 1 to 1.5 hours on SWA. 

Positives:
Happy employees
ontime--mostly
Free bags
Easy to change flights
refundable tickets aren't that much more
faster internet than GoGo Wireless

Negatives
Old planes
Weird boarding process
really crowded with inexperienced travelers

Net-net, I'll fly Southwest, but always allow for extra time. I guess you can waste time with an always late airline, or standing in a crazy TSA line. Air travel needs an overhaul!"
2012-04-14,Southwest Airlines,kLVvsifv_nUJQw9OkIgtEw,5,"An outstanding business model with wonderful people to execute makes for a very successful enterprise.

I've been a loyal Southwest customer for many years, traveling for both business and pleasure frequently. But Southwest was not an easy choice. Growing up in Denver and watching Frontier grow as the hometown airline where you couldn't help but have an emotional connection (I was incredibly loyal to Frontier). However, unlike Frontier, or others that try to make you feel special on the outside, but slowly push you towards the realization that they're nothing more than just a money making facade, Southwest is the real deal.

First, no great business can have mediocre people. And I'm convinced that mediocre are bred at large facilities specializing in making people robot drones that have no personality, no ability to think critically and follow an exact script- insert US Airways training facility here.

Southwest however actually allows their employees the freedom and ability to ACT! Their opinions respected and their decisions honored. What other airline allows their flight attendants to ""buy"" the guy in seat 22A a drink for moving yet a few more rows back to accommodate a family with screaming children? Unfortunately in most other places that drink would have been inventoried, check-listed and held under lock and key until the payment cleared the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan returned back to Washington to approve.

Second, the business model. For the customer it's easy, it's convenient and it's actually flexible! You can figure out with a very low IQ exactly how everything works. Need to change a ticket? Yes, and there is no, ""bam! surprise $150 change fee.""

Fly frequently? In a very short period of time you're considered a loyal customer and placed on the A-List or A-List Preferred- which also happens to be the best loyalty program in the world. Yes, I said it... world! If you disagree, go educate yourself. Free priority baggage check and priority security screening so that arriving at the airport 2 hours before your scheduled departure isn't necessary- yes please.

Kind of like the tooth fairy as a kid, though even more unexpected Southwest actually puts stuff in my mailbox. The most beneficial of which are my annual birthday card (1 of two birthday cards I received this year; thanks mom) and DRINK COUPONS! Hooray for free drinks.

I keep reading reviews that say Southwest is great for short flights, however I believe that Southwest is great for ANY flight. I also read reviews about the uncomfortable seats... really? At 6'5"" I would consider myself just shy of an expert on airline seating arrangements. Really though, the experts over at SeatGuru have confirmed what I've known to be true for a very long time. Southwest seats have more space between the seat in front of them and the best ""full, upright position"" seat pitch. Unless you pay for an upgrade over at US, Southwest has the most comfortable seats in the airline business.

--Side note, I actually have to sit with my feet elevated off the ground on most planes as the distance from my lower back to knee is greater than the space between the back and bottom of the seat and the frequent flier magazine crammed into the seat back pocket of the seat in front of me. Now that just sucks- and I don't have to deal with that with Southwest.

Overall, a phenomenal airline with great people that make flying just a bit more exciting and dare I say it, enjoyable. Thanks Southwest- you guys rock!"
2012-04-20,Southwest Airlines,wDDj3Fnte9sCioECoPuASA,1,"Southwest Airlines portrays themselves as a great bargain with ""no hidden fees"".  However, they are no bargain when it comes to the fares they charge.  They are priced the same as other carriers.  But that is not my issue with them, its the ""no hidden fees"" they claim do not exist.

I flew from Phoenix to Oakland CA round trip for $370.00.  On my return, my meetings ended early and I went to the airport 5 hours early to see if I could get on another flight stand-by.  I soon discovered Southwest does not do ""stand by"".  Yes, there was an earlier flight and it was about half full.  But if I wanted to get on that plane, I had to pay the difference in the airfare which was $163.00.  The later flight I was booked on was over sold.  I tried to reason with them and they flat out refused to accomodate me.  

I own a business and fly quite a bit.  I had hoped SW Air would be a good choice.  It was clearly not.  If your travel plans are locked in and will not change and you have a bag under 50 lbs (do not go even 1 lb over or its $50), and you do not mind the old planes and paying the same fare as much nicer airlines, then SWA is your airline.  But, if you may need to try to catch an earlier return flight sometimes and want to go stand by, there is no Stand By with Southwest.  Essentially they make you buy a one way ticket to go on an earlier flight.  Dont even bother appealing it, they do not care.  I was very pleasant, nothing worked.  I called supervisors as i sat in the airport, they did not care.  I contacted higher ups in Linkedin, no one ever responded.  

US Air as I found later had a fare $100 cheaper and they allow their customers to go stand by on earlier flights at no extra charge.  They are the airline I will be using in the future.  Every Southwest commercial I see now really irritates me with their false advertising.  The red tape, no hidden fees, etc.  At least the other airlines do not try to portray themselves as something they are not.  Southwest does.  I will never fly that airline again unless their are the very last option, I would take Greyhound before I would fly them.  Old dirty planes, some (not all) rude and unempowered employees, and some very underhanded and dirty fees.  I warned a friend and he just had the exact same thing happen to him in Vegas.  They wanted him to pay the fare difference of $135 to catch a flight 4 hours earlier.  

You have been warned."
2012-04-27,Southwest Airlines,LKlnuXqsna_UapQhnU6QSA,5,"After 20 years of traveling around the world a five star review for an airline seems crazy to me but most recently I have been very impressed with Southwest.  The fairs are very reasonable almost certainly less in every case compared to the competition and with no hidden fees.  The free bags (your first 2) was also a huge part of the rating for this company.  On a recent flight with US Airways we paid more than $150.00 just for extra baggage fees to fly with them.  Goodbye US Airways you have lost our business forever.  Our last couple of flights to Vegas on Southwest we actually arrived ahead of schedule.  

The open seating on Southwest was a little different however once we got used to it this was actually a great concept as everyone simply chooses the seat they want.  If seating is of great importance to you just get their a little early and you will have first choice of the entire plane.  Awsome.  

Finally, a feature that I love with Southwest is that you can manage your own tickets online.  Example:  We bought tickets to fly to San Diego a couple months ago $151.00 round trip - great price and weren't able to make the flight.  I simply went online to my Southwest account and changed our reservations with absolutely no fees.  How cool is that.  I can simply book my own travel and make changes up to the day of departure with no additional fees or penalties.  We have done this a couple times and it actually works out great for Southwest because they done have to pay for employees to amend our schedules and in our case we actually upgraded our flight so everyone wins.  

On time hassle free flights, very friendly staff, free bags, lowest fares, open seating and my own personal online management systems are all reasons this airline deserves the best rating available.  Damn good job Southwest.  See you soon."
2012-05-11,Southwest Airlines,WXeFOmHqA4KYYF1_UChleQ,5,"I have never really had any bad experiences while flying, especially on Southwest. The fact that you can have two checked bags and a carry-on free is awesome for the wallet, and their planes and staff are nice. The only problem I had in Phoenix was that there was a delay, but when it's about the plane it's not on the airline. Great job SWA!"
2012-05-29,Southwest Airlines,KJ2NJWX9Jecll6bnZ7k33A,5,"This airline is awesome.  Prices are alway reasonable if you shop the prices.  They have almost always been on time for us at Phoenix.  Sometimes lines can be long, so arrive early unless you are on an early flight.  Gate staff is always super helpful with our stroller tags."
2012-06-13,Southwest Airlines,5Hdoioj1xE3Iu6aE6i-W_A,5,One word: Outstanding!
2012-06-20,Southwest Airlines,vmbvIRQMw86L4LrgWjNvzA,1,"Use to be the best airline. Now they won't let you use banked monies from family. They are also stupid not letting you fly standby for earlier flight, Thereby freeing up later flights. They have raised their rates so much on last minute flights that the are more expensive than almost every airline."
2012-07-22,Southwest Airlines,QavZuTbSDRSe8Ff26LzzDQ,5,"i just simply love southwest airlines. a) the crew. i have never been on a southwest flight where the crew wasn't positive and smiling (ever flown Delta? complete opposite). b) the onboard snacks. they will give you as many as you want! and they're decent snacks! c) no baggage fees. quite possibly the most desireable aspect of an airline (besides quality planes of course). i had 2 giant checked bags and the no-fee came in super handy for that. 

the only thing i'm still torn on is the free for all boarding. i have to make sure to call 24 hrs prior to boarding to get an A section boarding, and then i'm always nervous that the late-comers will be a gigantic, spill into my seat passenger or a couple with a mess of screaming babies. i jest......

southwest is by far the best airline out there!!!!!"
2012-08-31,Southwest Airlines,REa-NXWD-n1hAC8hfnqaBw,5,"What can I say about Southwest that has not been said.
 I have flown on them many times now.  I have always been very happy with Southwest Airlines.
Easy to book a Flight and easy to fly on. TSA which I know has nothing to do with the airline, but it is not bad going through their side of the Airport.
 Everyone is friendly with a sense of humor. 
They still serve snacks when they can. Plus the Planes are clean.
Price is good most of the time.
Give them a try next time you fly."
2012-09-13,Southwest Airlines,wrYbUVPsYvCRQlWoz6YB1Q,5,I love flying southwest! Everyone is always so friendly. I never pay for bags and time after time their prices are better then any other airline. They are my first choice!
2012-09-26,Southwest Airlines,0YN2w1UJ5dPYfC6zuIFGhg,1,"Up until my last trip i was a huge southwest fan. Let me tell you what changed that. Ok i know traveling on a buddy pass is a crap shoot, but i didnt know that southwest employees treat you like garbage. I was trying to get from Mississippi where i went and saw my sons college football game on saturday(9/22/12). Getting there was ok, getting home on Sunday was a true nightmare. I flew from Mississippi to Chicago with no problems. Once in Chicago the nightmare started. The first flight to Phoenix was at 12:05pm Chicago time. I was bumped from that flight and every flight th erest of the day, a total of 8 flights i was bumped from. I was told by a southwest employee at the gate(Kristen) that the lesson learned was that i shouldnt be so cheap and next time buy a regular ticket. (wow). 
So stuck in Chicago there was a flight at 830pm to las Vegas, which i did get the last seat on. Once to vegas there were no more flights to phoenix and the gate agent stated that i had used all my passes up with that flight to Vegas, so basically i was stuck in the airport over night. I sleep on the floor and was told that someone would be in at 4am and to check with them if i could catch a flightto Phoenix. So as i layed on the floor over night i thought about what Kristie had said to not be cheap and buya ticket, so to me southwest treats customers like trash. O before i forget i also jst tried to purchase a ticket from Chicago to Phoenix and was told i couldnt do so because i started my travels on a buddy pass and i had to end my travel with a buddy pass..I will never use southwest again PERIOD......................Worst Airline experience in my Life.."
2012-10-21,Southwest Airlines,y97DXYfSabIgsZA-U_jISg,5,"after what seemed like forever, i was on southwest after a 4 month hiatus from arizona. 

the flight was delayed in atlanta, but the gate crew tried their best to lighten the mood, apologizing constantly and then throwing some jokes around. the flight was packed, yet the flight attendants were friendly and helpful the entire trip. they even walked up and down the aisle with iPads talking to customers and mapping out their connections in phx. as usual, you can get plenty of free snacks and drinks and the attendants are consistently up and down the aisles asking if you need anything. 

at one point, one of the flight attendants just started singing on the PA. i thought it was hilarious, even though she didn't sing that well. 

great to have a fun flight home."
2012-11-13,Southwest Airlines,0m_sLSqnKpcPsyYj0KzBmg,5,"Another vacation, another great flight with Southwest!!!!!"
2012-11-15,Southwest Airlines,YEBnWb8Ja50m8uykLeN-Ww,5,"I'm definitely a fan of Southwest Airlines. I needed to go to Chicago and found that the other airlines were a bit too greedy. I must admit I wasn't too keen on flying into Midway versus O'hare, but I was pleasantly surprised.

About the only nutty thing I didn't like is that you have to check in for your flight exactly 24 hours before your flight to get a better boarding number. So I got A33 & A34 on my first try, not bad for a rookie. They even text me the next morning that the flight was delayed 1/2 hour and also text me when there were gate changes. Got to love this modern technology. I checked my baggage curbside for the first time on a domestic flight in probably about 20 plus years since there was no luggage check in fee. It was nice not having to lug my bag around. It sure made it easier going through security.

On the return trip I had to go through the counter since I was coming from the rental car drop off. They have such a systematic check in feature where the sign tells you when and where an agent is ready to help you.

The snacks were awesome on the plane as well. I can't remember the last time I had one of those orange crackers with the cheese, YUM. I must admit that I also double dipped and had those vanilla oreo cookies too.

I will definitely be a repeat customer so I can't wait for my next trip."
2012-12-22,Southwest Airlines,pLDD8GnVZUOWeXop6jndww,4,"really nice airport, it has all the stores that you need and coffee- conveniently located restrooms and the southwest gate area is nice as well. I like southwest because they're cheap (250.00 for a round trip tix from ontario, CA to NJ with a stop in PHX)"
2013-04-09,Southwest Airlines,5dTvnur-xyDU0srFof3Vmw,5,"Southwest is my favorite airline. The end. 

Well, I won't leave you hanging there. If you've never flown Southwest, you're missing out. The only reason I won't fly Southwest is they don't fly where I'm going, like earlier this year I had to go to Montreal, Canada and Kingston, Jamaica. Had to fly another carrier...oh well. 

I love Southwest's No Assigned Seating policy. I love their idea of snacks -- we're talkin' REAL snacks, and as many as you want! They have the same beverage service as other airlines. The employees have a sense of humor, frequently making passengers laugh during their usually-mundane required tasks. I love that I can check in from their mobile app and print the boarding passes later, unlike some other airlines (some you can, but not all). And the seats are more comfortable, it seems like. 

Love Southwest. All the time."

2013-08-05,Southwest Airlines,JoEQe_VVbJP-FzOBF3QfyQ,5,"I actually fly Southwest 99% of the time and I fly a pretty good amount. I actually consider SW the best airline for the price conscious consumer. I'll list some of the factors below...

1. Prices on airline tickets are fairly cheap. Not Spirit or Allegiant Air cheap. But those two airlines charge for every little thing you request. EVERY LITTLE THING HAS A FEE.

2. Two bags fly free is awesome. You don't have to sign up for a credit card or do anything. FREE. I went on American Airlines and it was $25 for my first bag and $35 for my second. That's like over $100 roundtrip with a more expensive ticket.

3. The attendants are nicer than the other airlines from what I experienced. And the cabin is pretty nice too with the leather seats.

4. Free pretzels, water, peanuts and non-alcoholic drinks. Just recently, they offered free on board TV streaming to mobile devices. Not a very good selection of channels but the TV shows like The Office was not bad.

5. Change flights without a fee. Just pay the flight difference. See the same flight a cheaper price? Change it and get credit back for your next flight. WHAT??? Yeah, it's true. Try it sometime. After you buy your ticket, check out the prices for the next few weeks... if it dips, just change your flight and get credit back. Same deal if you book with points. You get the points difference back.

So there you have it. There's a lot of stuff I like about SW but these are probably the big ones.

EXTRA TIP: You need to finish checking your bags about 50 minutes before departure. Otherwise, the bags will be flown on the next flight and you'll have to wait for your bags and get a $50 credit. But they will deliver it to your hotel or wherever if you can't wait and not give you the $50 credit."
2013-09-26,Southwest Airlines,wnLJ0UrFEmwCvenMnj1u6w,1,A surprise from Southwest Airline today. I have trouble traveling by myself and carry my handicapped motor vehicle tag with me for actual proof.  Well after a long day on my feet yesterday and hardly able to walk or stand in line today I asked the agent for an early boarding pass explaining my problem. Well to my surprise even though I had A34 she would not assist me in anyway. She said I could upgrade for 40.00 to seat number 5.  Seriously  sorry I bothered her at 7:30 this morning.  How awful is that?  So I stand in line in horrible pain. Thank you Southwest agent at gate C4 this morning. I hope you never experience pain!
2013-10-06,Southwest Airlines,5uhwhQvZ6Snjoo7t-99oyA,4,"Cheapest airlines out there.  No checked bags fee, up to two per flight per person.  No change fee, only need to pay the difference in fares.  Fly to almost anywhere and everywhere in the U.S.  First come, first serve seats, you do however need to check-in at least 24 hours in advanced before your departure date for best seats.  The flight attendants are always happy and actually love their jobs.  They will give you whole can of soft drinks if you ask for it, and they would gladly give you unlimited free refills if you ask nicely.  One bad thing about this airline is that they don't have any international flights, especially to Canada and/or Mexico."

When I finally asked if there was going to be a chance to get on the flight, the rude attendant told me there was no more room left. Screw you and your damn A-list members!

Big Time. The ""low fare"" airline completely restructured its frequent flyer program so that they no longer reward you for flying frequently.They reward you for paying higher fares! Yes, it really is that hypocritical. Pay more and get more points. Find and use low fares at the ""low fare"" airline and you are penalized severely. The current frequent flyer program is worthless. Programs like that are a real motivator to me and many other frequent flyers. We are not going to pay more to deceive ourselves into thinking we are getting something ""free.""  Nor are we going to rip off our companies by intentionally paying higher fares just to qualify for perks we used to earn by virtue of flying all the time with SWA. They've completely alienated me.

Overall, the flight was pretty lousy.  It's hard to make 5 hours in a plane appealing, but Northwest didn't try to make things any easier.

- No movie.  NW Airlines only shows films on international flights.
- No in-flight radio.
- No peanuts.  Isn't that our reward for being good little passengers?!?
- Scarce pillows and blankets (this was important to note because the plane was soooo cold).
- Flight Attendents use the intercom to try and sell their rewards progams and special deals for the SkyMall cataloge.  Booo!  I don't want to hear your freakin' sales pitch!  Leave me in peace!

2008-09-24,Northwest / KLM Airlines,wwoLKFnIhxffcQVcdX2o4g,3,"The most important thing to me in an airline is that we do not fall out of the sky in an uncontrolled fashion. After all landing is a controlled crash. So far they have done well in this area.

It seems each flight I have had with this airline the seat is not working as it should. It always leans back and will not set straight. One gets tired of telling the attendant that no I can not bring the seat up to upright position. This last flight seat was quite uncomfortable, my rump was sore soon after we took off. This is the second thing past crashing that I think an airline should consider, comfort of the seating area. Arriving back in Phoenix one goes to pick up the checked bag. one waits and waits and waits some more, two other flights that landed since we arrived have come and gone. A bunch of grumpy tired travelers is not a pretty sight to behold, Luckily they only had to look over at me to see the face of calm and patience ;-{) We finally got home at 12:01 am after landing at 10:40 p.m.

But hey we did not crash so they are A-OK with me.

Oh and we know airlines do not pamper anymore, well unless we are on an international flight. So we know to take what we need to keep us happy in the air."

They make flying as painless as possible.  The staff is friendly.  They are prompt with snacks and drinks.  There is a wide selection of radio stations to listen to.  For flights 1.5 to 3 hours they screen a selection of TV shows, over 3 hours and you get a movie.  What makes time go faster than watching a classic episode of the Simpsons or clips from SNL?

The last time I flew United was with my husband (then fiance). We were going to India. For our wedding. In several days. The ticket counter woman wouldn't let him on the airplane because she said he didn't have a proper visa for flying through Frankfurt. He didn't need one. He told her, and proceeded to pull out a letter from the German Consulate in LA which stated ""You don't need a visa to fly through here to India.""
She replied: ""I don't care WHO you got a letter from, I'm not lettin' you on the plane!""

Twenty minutes later, we convinced her to let him fly to Chicago, our layover, where he would recheck-in for our connection on Lufthansa. She yelled ""They'll just tell you what I""m telling you!""

They didn't. She was wrong. But thanks to her antics, he got a seat assignment far away from me and we had to sit separately on the 10 hour flight. 

When I wrote to United to complain (informing them that if she had succeeded in not letting him on the plane we would have MISSED OUR WEDDING) I never heard back from them. Ever. Nothing. No email, not apology, nothing. Which is why I am never flying their shitty planes ever again."

United - You.Fucking.Suck.  If it was possible for me to give you negative stars I would.  Now this review isn't actually for the Phoenix branch, but for the company as a whole, because the Phoenix employees were great.  I will have to try to make this as brief as possible, because I could write a novel about my hatred for this God forsaken company.

In brief:
On a business trip from Phx to Winnipeg, Canada my bags were tagged incorrectly in Phoenix.  They put my tags on someone else's bags and vice versa on mine.  Needless to say when I arrived in Canada  - no bags!  The worst part, it was FREEZING.  Like 30 degrees F.  I had just come from hot ass Phoenix wearing only a tank top, thin sweatshirt and capris.  Fast forward to the end of my trip.  Not only have I not received my bags, I have received no help from the 1-800 number that was outsourced to India (don't even get me started).  I told people numerous times that my bag was not where they thought it was (Denver) but was where the other lady whose tags I had went.  Do you think they listened...NO!  They continued to read their script, over and over and over again.  If I could have reached through the phone and slapped them I would have.  I had to buy all new stuff for this business trip, stuff I will never need again, then buy a new suitcase to haul all the shit back in.

When I arrive back in Phoenix in the dirty capri pants I had been wearing for 4 days I go to the baggage claim office to speak to a real person, in person.  The woman there found my bag in 2.5 seconds, and it was right where I told her it was.  Too bad the fuckers on the 1-800 number couldn't do their jobs properly and figure that out.  Oh, and they have the same systems, and can see the same stuff as the people in Phoenix, I asked.

I was told my bag would arrive back that day, but it didn't come.  So then I was told it would come back the next evening, very late and would be returned to my house.  I wake up at 1 AM, almost one week after the last time I had seen my bag to find a black rolling suitcase on my porch.  Hooray!  But my excitement was short-lived, because that bag was not mine!  They had switched my bag AGAIN!  Really?  Twice?  Now that's just stupid...who isn't doing their job.

I had to drive back to Phx International for the third time, pay parking for the third time and deliver the poor schmo's bag that was on my porch.  After a 2 hour wait my bag comes back.  Reunited, and it feels so good.

Now for the best part.  It has taken 2 nasty faxes to United to get them to respond to my requests for reimbursement of the things I had to buy.  Yesterday I get an envelope in my mailbox from them - nope, not a check.  A request for my receipts.  Really?  I think that was included in the 15 page fax I sent to you twice.  Or are you really that incompetent?  So here I sit, 2 weeks later, $400 poorer and mad as hell.  

If you can get away with it, don't fly United.  They don't care about their customers at all."
2008-08-12,United Airlines,Ep_maGGzwwwyf_IaNt4q1g,1,"They still fucking suck.  But I should say that I did get a whole whopping $150 back from United for the items I had to buy and have not used.  Oh, my friend just had her bag lost by United this past weekend also.  The people on the 1-800 in India were just as useless to her as well.  I don't even know why they have their systems there if they can't seem to tell you anything.

""I'm sorry for your inconvenience maam, but we do not have record stating whether or not your bag made it on the plane.""  

They make you pay extra to check the bags, just so they can lose them.  Its total bullshit and there is nothing we can do about it."
2009-01-12,United Airlines,abuI05l2crts2p_KmYLUGw,4,"Flying with any airline can be painful, as many reviews indicate.  Over the last ten years of nearly weekly travel I have come to know many of the Phoenix employee's of United/Ted at Terminal 2.  I have to say that all of them are great!  Everyone here is challenged with many bad things every day, weather, delays, mechnical problems, air traffic control, and worst of all - egotistical travellers.

I have seen so many rude travellers over the years, my mind reels at  how these guys can keep their sanity.  With very few exceptions there are just a ton of superstars at United in Phoenix.    

The Red Carpet club is staffed by many of my United favorites and they are always kind and helpful as well.  At least at Terminal 2 you can at least find an employee and get help compared to many airports across the country.

Travel sucks, but United sucks less than the others!"

Most one-day passes are around $40 and if you've got an international connection, one pass usually gets you in to _any_ club on your selected airline that day.

If you've never done it, take my advice. Splurge on yourself. You deserve it!"
2010-02-11,United Airlines,QMz0SusMk9jYdrNih3_p7g,1,"Look, bad experiences happen to everybody sooner or later. Sometimes customers are rude and won't acknowledge it. Other times, employees have a bad day and don't handle situations appropriately.

But I have to say, after having flown United on the last four trips I took - three of them multi-leg international trips and one of them a direct flight coast-to-coast - I gotta say that United is just an awful airline.

Planes - decrepit and worn-out. Old. Every last one of them that I was on, was from the 1980s. In-flight entertainment which was primitive; playing a single movie for everyone from a Hi-8 videotape. That's just sad. Fortunately, it's the 21st century (everywhere but on United flights) so I can bring an iPod and watch a movie with my earbuds (but I can't plug it in to keep it charged!!! Because this is United - christ, the AC outlets in the lavatories don't even work. Psych!)

Flight attendants - CLEARLY hate their jobs and the customers, ALL of them. Well, except of course if they think you are a rich sugardaddy who can rescue them from their shitty jobs. I am painfully polite at all times to people who have to deal with the general public, I know it can be hard and you often can't tell people what they really deserve to hear. 

It must be said that United flight crew are equal opportunity, they are rude to EVERYONE whether passengers are polite and as undemanding as possible, or whether they act like rude, clueless jerks.

I saw one flight attendant pick up a newspaper someone had put under his seat (in flight, it had slid into the aisle) and THROW IT into the lap of the passenger, as if he had purposely put it there to annoy her and ruin her day.

On several occasions, I've tried to make a little small talk with a United attendant - not to hit on them or flirt with them, just friendly banter. Each and every time, I got treated like I'd offered them a handful of shit. The attitude was very clear, 'don't fucking bother me; I hate you, I hate my job, I hate every fucking person on this plane.'

Well guess what you dumb twat: I'm sorry they've slashed your pay and increased your workload, but I don't like flying your piece of shit airline either. None of us want to be here, but I'm trying to make the best of it. Is it too much to ask you to do the same? I mean, if you are going to treat me like this, I might as well treat you like shit too. Maybe I'll go back to my seat and needlessly ring you over. At least that way I will have EARNED your hateful, imperious attitude.

Seating- UNCOMFORTABLE. Barely enough room for my legs, and while I am slightly on the tall side, I am thin not fat. Should not have had an issue with this!

During a couple of these international flights, I had legs which were NOT United. BIG difference. Modern, clean airplanes with modern in-flight entertainment systems. Friendly flight attendants. Adequate leg room.

The only good things I can say about United is that they did get me to my destination safely and my bags did show up, undamaged. I guess I should count my blessings. Nevertheless, I'm avoiding United whenever possible."
2010-03-05,United Airlines,1CR_aGGmvO97-Gwabtxwjg,1,"I don't scare easily...but I'm not immune to dread:)

There are a few things that make me break out in a cold sweat:

* Circus Clowns - I mean really...who thought this was amusing in the first place?

* Any of the ""reddish"" colored PT Cruisers - Careening around, always filled with 90 year old snowbirds and always micro seconds away from hitting something...I just don't want it to be me:)

* Outlaw motorcycle gangs - as opposed, I guess, to non-outlaw or in-law motorcycle gangs:)

* The Maricopa County Sheriff - ""Your papers are NOT in order...ve haf vay's uf makink you talk""

* Airlines that have lost the will to live - United Airlines comes to mind:(

I have a lot of miles logged with good old ""Untied"" Airlines...for a few years, I flew in excess of 250,000 miles per year...that's more than many of their pilots:)

And they treated me well...always in the front of the bus...free use of the Red Carpet Club...extra miles for flights...all kinds of nice stuff:)

Then I hit a milestone with UAL...a million miles!...wow...a million miles...lifetime Premier 1K status...yay!

Then UAL hit a milestone...and it hit it hard:(

All of sudden, I wasn't 1K anymore...lifetime or otherwise...I wasn't flying very much and the program that they had in place ""vaporized"" at some point during UAL's lean years:(...and because the service was crappy and the attitudes and pricing at UAL were worse, I pretty much quit flying them altogether.

Let's fast forward to now...I've been flying a bit more lately and found myself back on UAL a couple of times recently (hey...if a client is buying my ticket...they can put me on whichever airline they want...except for Aeroflot...the only airline that truly, I'm not even kidding, terrifies me).

UAL has really taken a tumble...I have trouble coming up with anything positive to say about them other than ""we landed safely"":(

I've seen cattle being trucked to the slaughterhouse treated with more respect and dignity than UAL and its employees treat their passengers:(

I didn't see any smiles or witness customer/employee interactions that were pleasant the last time I flew these guys (a couple of years ago)...it's worse now:(

It seem everyone that works for UAL is unhappy!

Polite requests for information, ETA's, ETD's are met with snarls and stony faces...inquires about seat assignments are greeted with smirks and almost open derision...there are no ""pleases and thank you's"" in the cabin...apparently the sole objective of the flight attendants is to keep you seated and quiet, or to collect revenue:(

On my last flight with UAL, I saw a rather substantial flight attendant (in her early 70's, I estimate) intentionally ram the drink cart into a man's ankle...his crime was dozing and having a foot in the aisle...she snarled at him to keep his feet under the seat in front...so unpleasant and so nasty:(...and so protected by federal law...the same behavior at Safeway would get her arrested for assault:(

It makes me wonder about the pilots...are they so unhappy that one of them could decide to see if a 767 can bore a hole through a mountain?...probably not...but the thought scares me just the same:(

I understand why all these folks who work for UAL are unhappy...they've all had their pensions ripped away, they have taken massive salary cuts, their dreams have been dashed (it may even be that the only people still working for UAL are people that couldn't get hired anywhere else...sadly:(

So they are not going to be giving their best...maybe they are even looking to take it out on someone...I don't know...I fly other airlines that have had financial problems (Frontier to name one) and the people you meet are all still friendly and helpful:)

And there are still good airlines around that treat you pretty well and get you where you need to go with a minimum of grimacing:)

At UAL, it seems that it has become all too easy for the airline and its employees to take out their frustrations on the passengers, so...one sad little star for the founding member of the Star Alliance:("
2010-03-18,United Airlines,Y4iL0wJxcINqUxnAEVWTUw,1,"My very first review. And it's only one star. Oh boy. 

So here's my story: 

Over the Thanksgiving holiday, I went to visit my family up near Albany, New York. I booked my flight through Expedia for the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the Friday after. Short trip, yeah I know. After booking my flight, I found out that my brother and uncle were going up to Canada, and since Canada is one of the few countries I have not been to, I thought eh! what the hell, I'll just fly back home on Sunday. So I call Expedia to change my flight home. They informed me that I would have to contact the airline directly once I have started my flight (basically, call them from Albany and cancel/change the second half). Didn't sound right to me, but hell, I don't work for them, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I get to Albany on Wednesday and IMMEDIATELY call United to cancel the second half of the trip, having purchased another ticket (because I'm a firm believer in CYA (cover your ass, for those non-believers)). Spoke to a very friendly agent, and got the flight canceled and was informed that I would receive a travel credit to be used before November 2010. Sounded good to me, I hung up the phone, life was good...until today. I call United to find out the amount of my travel credit because I have a few trips to take in the upcoming months and figure no-time-like-the-present to use up the little flight credit. First call to United, the lady said, no, you have to call Expedia because that's who booked the flight. I informed her that I canceled the flight DIRECTLY with United and Expedia told me that anything regarding travel credit would be handled by United. Makes sense to me. Since it was the United employee in November that informed me I would have a credit with them. Nevertheless, after her putting me on hold 7 times, her story did not change. So then, I think, well maybe I'm wrong. It's happened before. So I call Expedia and talk to a pleasant lady named Rose. She reiterated that the credit would be directly with United, Expedia is completely out of the picture on this one. Soooo, I call United back and speak to a different guy. His story is that the information of my flight in November has been purged from their system and there is no record of it at all. (Yes, this story is SLIGHTLY different than the first lady, but it all goes back to NO travel credit on file for me and the only thing they see for me is an upcoming flight in April, although I have flown with them at least 3 times in the past year). If I had known today was going to go this way, I NEVER would have scheduled another United flight. As it stands, after April, I am done with them. Completely. It's not that the credit is for alot of money, because it isn't. But I travel ALOT. And if I can't count on my airline to keep track of my record for 4 months, let alone TWELVE, then I am not going to pay them. Period. I'm so aggravated."

Okay so over the weekend I found myself thinking more and more about what was happening with the travel credit, and I started to feel slighted, pushed aside...and for those of you that don't know me, I don't deal very well with that particular feeling. (You can probably thank my Leo-signage for that). Well anyway, today I decided that I would give this issue another shot, I would allow them one more chance to redeem themselves....

They came up short. 

So I spoke with two representatives, as one of them decided that after I asked for a supervisor, she would just simply hang up on me. Yeah, nice try lady, thank you for the additional ammo. Ugh.

So I call back, get another representative...a mumbler no less...couldn't understand a word coming out of her mouth, but I reiterated my request to have a supervisor handle the issue, so after 10 minutes of waiting (were they waiting for me to give up? *insert evil laughter* Silly Mortals!) 

Anywho, I got 'Rick'. Yes, I am certain that this was an alias. But whatever, you can tell me to call you Don Quixote as long as you fix my issue (the one with the airline...my other 'issues' I own completely and sometimes revel in having them)...so 'Rick' is able to pull up the information (how is it that HE can see it and no one else can?? I dunno). 

Rick sees the flight that I called in to cancel, then he says call Reservations and they'll take care of it for you...this raises my ire. 

""Rick"", I say, "" I have been trying to do that very thing of which you speak for several days, I really need for you to come up with a better option than passing me on to one of those morons who are unable to pull up past flight records."" 

Apparently Rick is not impressed by my condescending tone, so he gets snippy. 

'In lieu of your travel credit, I will place a $150 travel voucher on your account and send you an email with the information. They will be able to see that""

...so then I say in my sweetest, most dulcet temptress voice (because he's still kind of being a prick), ""If I do not receive your email, how would I be able to get back in contact with you, or will you leave a note on my account in some manner?"" 

To which Rick the Prick says, ""You can call our 1-800 number."" 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this doesn't sound AT ALL like customer appreciation, it sounds like a brush off, but I put my ire aside and ask again, as if he may not have heard me, 'Will you be making a note to my account so that if I have to call again, the next person will know what I am talking about?'

R the P mumbles, 'I noted your account'. 

And I say, in a voice sweeter than the stickiest cotton candy that has ever made you puke at a carnival ""You're THE BEST RICK! Thank you SOOOO MUCH!"" 

And with a mumbled 'Thank you for calling United' he goes off into the night...

Moments later, I got my email with the voucher information. 

I am pushing them up to 2 stars for not making me call them again to get this matter resolved. But I stand by my decision that once this voucher is used, I will never darken their door again. 

Thanks but no thanks.

I remember as a kid flying Untied and the stewardesses and stewards looked with it and dressed with a certain snap to their vest. They had a sex appeal and you longed to be one.

But they did get us there and they didn't lose our luggage , of course we carried it on ..but there is always the potential. 

While not bad these days they just aren't good. And when one is flying across the country , one hopes and prays for a few niceties may be left . But alas in everyday flying one must suffer that which we call the friendly skies . 
Now these days you hope to have your legs not literally crushed , my poor 6'4"" husband was pinned in to a quite gruesome pretzelish shape.You hope for a wrapped clean pillow and maybe a decent snack .

After taking the shuttle from terminal 4 to terminal 2 we find our flight isn't leaving til first, 11pm then 11:15pm then 11:30pm changing constantly until it reaches midnight!

We wouldn't be getting home until 3am or later.  The woman was SO rude saying it was a weather related issue and there was nothing to be done.

Somehow the universe stepped in and this witch of a woman got us on a US airways flight that was leaving 30 minutes later (in a different terminal, with a different ticket we weren't checked if for ). I will NEVER EVER fly United again."
2012-08-01,United Airlines,bv_M1Mk2DGRsX3ALd3Yb3A,4,"Some people are so damn whiney.  Seriously?  You're reviewing these companies based on uncontrollable issues like weather delays and ATC.  Next time take a damn train, becuase your the grumps that I hate sitting next to, texting when all electronics are suppose to be off.

Now that I've gotten that off my chest, lets continue with the review.

The airline in general smells better than US, Southwest, and American, and for $30 more I can get extra leg room (or breathing room).  I once got bumped to a seat above the wing (very noisy and unpleasant view) after paying for an upgraded front row seat.  I called the airline to let them know, and my next flight was moved to first class.  The idea here people is to remain CALM (its not the end of the freaking world) and BE FRIENDLY!  It will get you much farther with customer relations, and with most humans in general.

One occaision I had to fly during a snow storm in Chicago.  I sat at the terminal for 3 hours waiting for it to slow, all the while coming down with a serious case of flu (sorry seat mates).  Fortunately, the flight attendants saw how miserable I looked once we boarded and moved me to an entirely empty row, brought me blankets and hot water, and were just plain wonderful.

Flights are generally pretty consistent with being delayed, but even then, the pilots make up for it in flight and get us there on time.

Meals:  Meh, its airline food, I'm not expecting gormet goodies.  Highschool cafeteria at best.  Your best bet is to grab something before boarding for a long flight.

Yes, sh*t happens, flights get delayed (bring entertainment), your seat mates stink to high hell (offer mints and lysol wipes for tables), and babies cry (tough luck, imagine how mom/dad feels).    

I will continue to fly United."
2012-09-20,United Airlines,YRdLJWZj7jQV_GkW1_xfCA,1,"Again - one star for lack of negatives.

So, to catch us up - flights are canceled because of the bad weather - otherwise known as blue skies and sunshine - and, after being trapped in my home airport for 6 hours, I am attempting to get another flight from Las Vegas to Seattle so that I can make it to my dad's wedding. (see previous review for story thus far)

Lord knows what language the customer service line guy spoke, but it wasn't English. I fired up my laptop and met him online to get another flight. He said that the best he could do is to put me on a 5:45 am flight to Phoenix, and then a 10:00 am flight to Seattle. Why on earth would I want to fly to Phoenix? He told me that was the best he could do, as there were no direct flights. ""You see, this airline doesn't actually fly to Seattle,"" he informed me.

Looking at ticket on hand, I could only assume one of us was losing it.

Online, my flight to Seattle disappeared, replaced by a flight to Salt Lake City. ""That should do it,"" he said. 

""Seattle isn't in Utah,"" I spurted.

""Oh, yeah..."" he said, and then put me on hold again. I prayed he meant, ""Oh, yeah - I forgot Seattle because we're so busy with all these complications due to weather,"" and not ""Oh, yeah, Seattle is the capital of Tanzania.""

It was 1:00 am. I was sleeping at home, at least for a couple of hours.

At oh-dark-thirty, I was sailing again through LAS TSA (love those guys!), I had no further issues with the new flight, other than that I was going in the opposite direction of my destination. Oh, and the seats are really tiny. But, we knew that.

After my layover in Phoenix, my cute little pink polka-dot carryon and I tried to board the flight that would finally get us to Seattle. The nice lady at the gate told me that I'd have to check my bag - the carry-on bag that I meticulously packed with three weeks' worth of clothing and necessities so that I would NOT have to check anything or pay their insane $50 fee. The one that flew this far with me, no problem. I asked why.

""Because the plane is too full for your bag, ma'am,"" she said as she wrestled it out of my hands. When I almost burst into tears, she told me that she'd wave the $50 fee. This time.

Gee, thanks.

I had to abandon my cute little bag with absolutely everything I would need for my trip at the end of the hallway, and hope like crazy that I'd see it again.

Now, I was the very last person on the plane. The overhead bins were still open, and what did I see? I could have stored my bag and every last bag of the traveling Seattle Seahawks in the spaces left. There was plenty of room for my bag!

My entire row was empty. I had no seatmates for the whole flight.

Neither did the guy behind me.

Or the lady across from me.

Full, huh? Or, full as in, ""We want another $50 and there's nothing you can do about it.""

Unbelievable. 

The flight attendants were polite, and the rest of the flight uneventful. I was just amazed at what I had to go through to get that far.

The good news is that my cute little pink bag was, in fact, returned to me in one piece. The bad news is that the one piece is stained with giant black streaks and smells of jet fuel and sweat.

Never again. United (aka US) airlines has UN-customered me for life."

2013-06-10,United Airlines,2rscbzTv7uqPAMqwJMbQkg,1,"SCREW YOU UNITED!!!! More like DIVIDED Airlines.

Worst customer service ever. Hands down. Worst. Not even going to lie.

I purchased tickets to fly from Phoenix to Fort Lauderdale and back. We were leaving May 2nd and returning the 5th. I purchased them through YOUR website at a nominal fee because they were straight through no stops which I thought was pretty epic. $620 a ticket? Straight through? No stops? Pretty bitchin deal I thought.

You sent me my conformation email giving me the flight numbers, times, insurance info all that happy shit. What you neglected to tell me was that this flight was actually through US Air. 

Parked at Terminal Two. Traveled FOREVER through Phx to get to your crappy out building somewhere in the BFE section of the airport an hour before my flight. It took 20 minutes to get through the line only for the kiosk, A FUCKING COMPUTER, to tell me that the flight was being run through US Air. A dickhead service guy then bitched and moaned about how WE, my husband and I, fucked up and you were not responsible and directed us to march our happy asses out of your mold infested fly catcher of a terminal and back onto the bus and back to, you guessed it, TERMINAL TWO where US Air was held in the real portion of the airport. 

Of course when we got there I was already hyperventilating because our flight was closed and we'd missed it. Lucky for us, and you, US Air is not only amazing, but HUMAN and got us taken care of no problems. Sure... It wasn't the straight through flight landing at 4 pm EST... And I'd have to sit in Charlotte FOREVER... And I wouldn't be landing until 1am EST some  9 hours later and TOTALLY having to pay for that hotel day anyway.

You people SUCK. Your customer service SUCKS. Talking to the people in your call center SUCKS. Writing a complaint to you and receiving no response other than it's my fault for not realizing that it was a code shared flight even though all of the documentation I have CLEARLY doesn't state that ANYWHERE (even in the fine print. I looked) SUCKS.

This is one airline that I sincerely hope happens to go the way of the dodo. Worthless."
2013-08-17,United Airlines,JwRBTCRmOEyVHYbIR9gQLg,3,"United wasn't too bad.  I usually fly Southwest but I thought United did a reasonable job.  Yeah, I don't like the A la carte thing.  Pay for TV, for wireless, for food, for luggage, for better seats.  What's next?  Oxygen optional?"
2013-09-17,United Airlines,92FIsxZ4TVugilRjIJivrg,1,"My lettter to united regarding online and phone reservations:
I have an issue with your website. I looked at booking tickets from PHX on Friday. At 11:15am, PST, I started my process and spoke with a lady named Jem. She said book online after answering my question. So I get online and find the flights home for $490 per person. I begin my booking and about 10 min later after entering information for everything including payment, I press ""process"" and I get an error message. So I proceed to wait half an hour and try again. This goes on until 1pm then I'm back on the phone with customer service because I can't get the website to process my payment. In the 45 minutes I'm on hold I finally receive the answer that the price has now changed to 636, then in 10 more minutes its 690 per person. What is wrong with United, this is dishonest, I start booking a flight for one price and have to pay another because my payment won't process online. Finally, the lady tells me she has escalated my issue and I'll receive a call back in 24 hours. That never happened. Today, Tuesday Sept 17th, I try again to book online at the $490 per person price and receive the same error. So I get Shea, employee ID 1-L, who after 23 minutes has no explanation as to why I see $490 but can only offer me $596 per person. This is the most ridiculous online booking process and worst customer service I have ever experienced with an airline. I wish I had a choice in airlines, but United is contracted with Great Lakes to fly into my hometown. Finally, after 23 minutes of arguing, Shea transfers me to Lisa in the "".com"" dept. Lisa is professional in hearing out my problems and resolves them in the next half an hour. Consider fixing your website via I.T. and empowering your employees, like Shea, to resolve issues as Lisa is able and you'll retain business instead of lose it. In fact, she's the only one I would hire for my personal business. I'm extremely disgruntled by United and can't be the only customer upset by such service."

I didnt even pick that and would never pay extra to sit in the middle...theres a reason those are the LAST seats to fill up everytime. Ive been trying to call and get ahold of them to make the changes for over 8hrs now and all I get is a automated attendant who after 5-6menus tells me nobody is available to help and to call back later, then it hangs up on me.

Yes, the terminal is older and it was crowded waiting for the gate. However, the bathrooms were very clean. The main purpose of this review is the fact that our flight attendants were so awesome on a flight from PHX to CLE yesterday. They had a sense of humor were patient and went above and beyond for our long flight. Not only did they come by often to clear trash but they made two trips with the beverage carts and then additional trips with water and coffee. The seats also seemed a little roomier than other airlines. Oh! And there was PLENTY of room in the overhead cabin so people weren't jamming carry-ons in there. What a nice flying experience!"

After being told I could pay $39 for premium seating (which is horse crap to begin with), I change my seats to the window seats I had been looking for and proceeded. United then tried charging me $208.00 for the ""upgraded"" seating option as apparently not all ""premium seats"" are created equal. Back to the middle seats for me as I have no patience for thieves and cheats."

I get to the counter at the curd and I am told that it is $25 for the 1st Bag...thankfully I only had one bag.  The gentleman at the counter saw my ID card and asked if I was traveling on orders because that was the only way they could waive the fee.  Yes, my gripe is about the baggage fee, but I just thought that was a little much.  Also, they charge you on the plane to watch TV.   I flew Delta on the outbound flight and had a great experience and got to watch NETFLIX for free...if I had to choose...go with Delta or Virgin."

2008-08-11,JetBlue,9A24Fyd08Yy2zjWHAZF8CQ,4,"I have been a Southwest-er for years, not really by choice, but because they fly from Burbank to Vegas all the time.  Southwest was really a choice motivated by convenience.

However, I recently had the opportunity to fly Jet Blue from Vegas to Burbank.  Its cool that they are flying non-stop to Burbank now, as Jet Blue is really a LOT better than Southwest as far as service, planes, and amenities go.

I love the fact they have TV and XM Radio for each individual seat.  They offer head phones for $1 if you don't have your own.  The seats are way more comfortable than Southwest - bigger, more leg room - and they give you a FULL CAN OF SODA and a snack - not just a cup of soda and peanuts like Southwest.

I'm not giving them 5 stars for two reasons:
1.  The flights to/from Vegas are MORE expensive than Southwest.
2.  The convenience just isn't there.  There is only 1 (or 2) Burbank to/from Vegas flights per day.  

I would definitely fly them again though!!!"

I understand weather issues, but TWICE in less than two months, 2 different aircraft's were grounded due to mechanical issues, that's pretty scary.

In Vegas' McCarran Airport, their terminal is always in the nice and newer wing (used to be at the D gates then moved to Terminal 3). I have only experienced one delayed flight only because of strong winds in Vegas. The free inflight snacks are better than the old bag of peanuts (terra blue chips, chocolate chip cookies, animal crackers, munchies and gourmet nuts).  Their planes have lots of legroom but if you want, you can upgrade to an Even More Space seat for more legroom and priority boarding. You can watch TV or listen to music at your seat without paying extra. You can check- in your first bag for free.

My fellow weary traveler and I were NYC homeward bound after two weeks in Asia and a short stint in Vegas for a friend's wedding. With overly stuffed suitcases and heavy, jetlagged hearts, we approached the check-in counter and were startled by one of the only friendly greetings we received in the land of Vegas.

Instead of checking our three bags, the airline rep suggested that we repack our bags to avoid a $40 charge and take the 3rd bag as a carry on. After doing so and just checking two bags, he deliberately looked the other way while the luggage was significantly over the weight limit. That's just good customer service. 

Oh yeah, and the flight itself was terrific. TV screens on every seat back, better snacks than any other airline, and friendly flight attendants. Love it."

SO convenient, simple and quick without all the crazy hassle and fuss you run into at LAX. There's less people and you can get to your gate within 15-20 minutes. Super fast especially if you print out your boarding pass beforehand so you can just go straight to security. 

My husband and I got to our gate a little too early and it turned out another flight was just about to take off in a few minutes back to Long Beach. One of the Jet Blue staff members approached us and asked if we'd like to head back on that earlier flight because there were extra seats left. AWESOME! Of course we took it! So we got to board right away instead of waiting another 1.5 hours for our original flight. They even gave us the extra legroom seating and we didn't even have to pay extra for it! So awesome!! :) 

It's great how they give you free snacks and drinks too. Love their Terra blue chips! ;)"
2014-05-26,JetBlue,FhsL71x7b9SRcmGZtpWiCg,1,"This airline has really bad customer service.  I have been a longtime customer of theirs but they will no longer get a single dollar from me ever again.  

I misclicked the wrong date on a ticket purchase and then when I tried to change the flight they wanted more than double the cost of the ticket to change it (this is extra fees, not including the price difference of the tickets); the flight was over 2 months away so its not like there was any real time crunch either.    

I asked to be transferred to someone who can make that decision to waive the transfer fees and was put in a never ending loop talking to person after person who kept transferring me around until finally they were rude interrupting me and finally hung up on me.   

Despite the fact that I have been using this airline for years they and have received 10s of thousands of dollars from me during this time they were unwilling to do anything to help me out.  Needless to say I was offended at how poorly I was treated.  Awe well, another airline will now get my money.

I recommend Virgin Airlines they are great, their planes are much nicer and the staff are much more accommodating and willing to help.  I know that an airline such as Jet Blue does not care about my business so I do not care about them anymore either.  What is 300 dollars in transfer fees on a flight that is over 2 months away compared to the 10s of thousands of dollars they have gotten from me in the past?  However, the emotional sting and the bad experience is enough for me to give my money to another airline for the rest of my life.  A really bad business move on their part.  I am but one customer but maybe this review will sway others from using this airline.  

These companies work for us.  Its our money we are the bosses.  Not the other way around.  They need us we do not need them.  When we spend money on a company we are paying for an emotional experience.  What terrible customer service.  What a negative emotional experience that I spent money on."

Me: *boarding* Um, no... but as a matter of fact I would love to.

When I was boarding, the VA employee was thinking that I had worked there.

My lover calls it Badlands Air (after the SF club) because the plane is uber-homosexual. It's like stepping into a gay man's house. Purple mood lighting, sleek electronics and smooth plexi-glass features. The attendants were all black because it's usually slimming and adds to the modernness of the whole experience. If they had condoms in the bathroom, I might start giggling. And of all the times I've flown, there is usually more male attendants then female. You see my point.

Staff is usually friendly, although the floor staff was a bit rude in light of their hideous delay. I even paid to be confirmed standby on an earlier flight and that was annoying. I'll give you a pass for that one.

Unlike, Jane V., however, I hope they do not expand. Can you really see a plane like this trying to fly somewhere like Boise, Idaho? I don't know about that one. But it is a very major metropolitan airline, so be sure that it will go to some other major cities...

Their prices are comparable to Southwest Airlines, but the airplanes are much newer and the staff are very professional. They also have an entertainment system for you to enjoy while you fly. You can choose from watching television, listening to music, watching music videos, playing games, chatting and a few other features. All it requires for you to be able to use it are a pair of headphones. 

I flew out Thursday night from SFO to LAS and returned from LAS to SFO Monday night and the fares were $69 there and $79 back. I've flown cheaper before, but I checked out that that's pretty much the going rates now. I used to check a bag in before, but just bring a carry on or two now. I was not affected by their $15 baggage check in which is pretty new for them. They allowed one free checked in bag not too long ago.

2010-01-10,Virgin America,u7tcy6Im6x8hLw-W2bdHTw,5,"Why can't the rest of the airlines be like Virgin.  It feels like I'm flying for the first time every time I board.  The planes have Direct TV on all seats. You can chat with others around the plane in the chat room.  You can play games because your arm rest opens up and in it is a game controller. You can order food or drinks straight from your TV. There are actual AC outlets by your seat to charge your electronics. There is Wifi that you can get for a small price.  Wow let me calm down because my heart starts racing.lol.  Overall you can get $39 one way tickets to vegas, LA, and San Diego or go to NY or Washington for about $200 bucks round trip. There is no beating that.  the planes are all brand new and the service is great.  Once you go Virgin youll never go back."

2011-01-03,Virgin America,muImsL0k-fOrs4huQyX2nw,1,"Never again.

Oh, I totally get the lure of the extra leg room and personal tv's. But let me make it clear. Those tv's, they charge you for it.

But that's not what has got my panties in a twist. 

Flying LAS- SFO and it's sardine city. Everyone and their mom has a rolly bag. Simple math, not everyone's rolly bag will fit in carry on overhead storage. So they start making announcements that people should check their rolly bag dimensions to make sure blah blah blah.... I just went through this with the same exact rolly bag 2 days prior and it fit no problem so I know it will fit.

Fast forward. I'm boarding....

Then I'm not.

Ive been pulled from the line to check my rolly bag. I plead ""but it fits I was just on this plane'. The robot tells me that she doesn't understand why it doesn't fit now but it must be checked. i smell her bullshit. Simple math. Too many rolly bags. Some must be checked. If they aren't checked willingly then staff must make up assinine stories to force the checking.

FUUUU Virgin. I don't like riding virgins anyway. Unsatisfying and not enough fun."
2011-07-25,Virgin America,fEh-L8gTrz2JLPm_XaGU1A,3,"Personal TV? Check
Plenty of Leg Room? Check
Lots of overhead bin space? Check
Cute girls sitting next to me on the way home? Double Check
Friendly Service? Check
Free Check-In Baggage? No Sir!

Flew this Vegas to SFO.. I usually fly on Southwest but due to last minute booking, Virgin gave me a much cheaper option.  

I  would give this 5 stars if they: a) offer free check in baggage b) flew to more airports c) offered the wi-fi for free on the plane

The plane ride and atmosphere is much more comfortable than Southwest... but I still can't get over that check-in baggage fee.  Seriously?  Luckily for some reason there was a lot of bin space but most other people have told me it's impossible to find space usually.

If you don't need to check in baggage, give it a shot! With all the extra fees and whatever I think I'll stick to southwest sine eI always check in at least 1 bag."

2011-09-04,Virgin America,Rb7SoQfWq9i028z3eOu7kQ,4,Really cool and different. Flew LAS to SFO and back. It's a short trip so didn't really get to use the entire entertainment console. Nice leather seats and good leg room. Great price via Priceline as well. I would definitely recommend it and will fly this airline again.
2011-09-14,Virgin America,X9NFY28T18qteQxz6brdGQ,4,"Pretty much one of the best airlines ever. They are known for their handsome/gorgeous friendly flight attendants and the great entertainment they have on board.. I mean who can resist messaging a random seat and chatting with them throughout their flight. The seats are WAY more comfortable than any other airlines too. Sadly, like most other airlines they charge for check in bags for regular main cabin seats, so I'll prob stick with Southwest for longer hauls."
2011-09-26,Virgin America,p2CdZDi1Blw8yRhxHxcm2g,5,"Best airline ever! Period. No one can touch them. Flying will never be the same. Their customer service is above and beyond what one would expect from an airline not to mention it doesn't feel like you're flying when you are on board. The seats are comfy, plenty of legroom, individual entertainment systems and if you are lucky you can score a free upgrade to main cabin select or first class. I highly recommend main cabin select to take advantage of more legroom and free food/drinks!"
2011-10-25,Virgin America,H77a9wI_4sx5nOcwn1PqPA,4,"Very nice airline. The screen in the front will definitely keep kids occupied. Just make sure you bring your own headphones. You can play games, watch certain tv shows and movies for free. Listen to music for free. Nice attendants. 
The only downside of this airline is that it cost $20 to check in a bag. I personally like to check in bags. So if you're going to check in a bag or two, fly southwest. Also, the wifi isn't free on Virgin anymore. You have to pay. I guess it would be worth it if your flight was super long, but flying from San Francisco to Vegas isn't worth it."

I was pleased; I hate having to lug that thing around, worrying about space, and likely looking like a weak idiot while struggling to load it up there (although I do mourn the Elnette hairspray I left in my hotel room; fiscally responsible me weighed $12 hairspray v. $25 check-in baggage fee). 

They seem to load the back of the plane first, a big plus in my eyes. People staring at you as you pass by to get to your seat gets quite awkward."
2012-01-18,Virgin America,X_TucGCOp6pK7N87uvKadg,3,"The check-in counter at the LAS airport is not as pretty as the ones back in other airports, it looks like a typical check-in station like any other ones in the airport. Their signature red wasn't found anywhere so they kinda blended in into the background. Our luggage was 3 lbs overweight and they had to make us take out a few items before we can check it in, no flexibility whatsoever. (side note: my sister had once traveled with a luggage that was at the exact size of an on-board luggage, but Virgin still made her check it in to make that $25). I personally think $25/luggage is a little steep because if they were offering any sort of other luxury then I would think its worth it. However, compare to the other airlines, they had to charge you $2 for earphone, no complimentary snack, and no legroom.

Then when we arrived to SFO, they announce our baggage claim was at gate 4, when later we found out all our luggage was actually coming out of carousel 3. Oops much? Virgin at Las Vegas wasn't the best, I would imagine other airlines might be a better choice."

Wi-fi during the flight is great also and I am actually using it right now to post this review however charging for it is so 10 years ago and cheap. I flew in Europe a few months ago and many airlines there provide it as a basic service. Do we really want to trail behind Europe in this or will VA step up and leave their US competitors behind by providing free Wi-fi?!"

They are five months into a pathetically inept transition to a new sabre-based reservations system, and still can't handle elementary transactions on-line.  Meanwhile, call center hold times are nearly an hour today.  My whole family flew Virgin for this vacation on my recommendation - I cannot begin to tell you how embarrassed I am, or how deeply I regret the recommendation.  Fly another airline, take the train, drive, walk ... or just stay home.  But whatever you do, don't go near Virgin America until you hear reliable reports that they've sorted this mess out.  No vacation is worth the amount of stress, anguish and hassle we've been through."

2012-04-11,Virgin America,CrnZfpFFIgagS--2-NLOAA,1,"I USED TO BE a huge fan and customer! First allow me to begin by understanding that any business has instances and as a business owner I understand that things can go wrong and people have their moments, but this airline has become way off-track and has serious problems. 
1.  I arrived at Las Vegas expecting, as any respected airline will have, curbside baggage check and or attendants. Not Virgin!  Caused me to be late and huge inconvenience.

2. I have a conference in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and from LAS, I decided to book through Virgin, and also my friend's flight through Virgin. I WAS such a fan that despite having to go through San Fran, I still booked through Virgin, as I knew Virgin has no directs to Ft Lauderdale from LAS. Even though I found direct flights cheaper in price to Ft Lauderdale I convinced my friend to book with me on Virgin. We booked weeks in advance and requested window and isle so that we could travel together.  When we arrived in SFO today on April 11, 2012on flight VX 342 dep 11:00AM I looked at my ticket and noticed that we were not sitting together. Going to the counter at the terminal to fix the situation I was told the flight was booked full. THEY LIED. We asked for seats closer to each other on the flight and we were told by a young and clueless Virgin ""Representative"" that we would be moved to isle seats across from each other. I then asked, as I fly very frequently, if the seat reclined? I was ASSURED they did. I'm stuck on a cross country flight in the full upright position!

3. To add INSULT to injury, when we board the flight, it's only 3/4 full!  With many empty seats, but none together. Now we are stuck on a long flight with seats that do not recline!!! 

4. To add to this horrible experience the flight attendant was the rudest airline staff member I have encountered and the issue was not the seat it was the fact that I lost a $2K Rolex dial either at the gate or in the plane and she acted like I lost a piece of gum, horrible attitude and she had no concern or assistance. Horrible and insulting experience. 

These were not simply isolated incidents. I was a fan of the airline. Please take my advice and understand I will never fly Virgin unless my life depends on it! Do not believe the hype of the 'cool lights' and a in flight mini screen!  This is a chain of experiences that have turned me from a long time Virgin America enthusiast and fan into a spiteful and resentful consumer. I will heed you with the advice from my friend as a first time Virgin flyer; "" The lights were cool but they treated us like SH-T. I will stick with an airline that sells me a SEAT, not a crap shoot and is rude."" I AGREE. DO NOT TRUST THEIR BOOKING SYSTEM OR TRUST THEIR STAFF TO ASSIST YOU OR TO BE PLEASANT."
2012-04-30,Virgin America,FXl3PQ4r0ltXU_TZlBG_3g,5,We have made several flights on Virgin and have never been disappointed!  If you get a chance to upgrade to Main Cabin Select or First class this is also a must do! They are always putting the customer first!  They are a real class act!
2012-05-16,Virgin America,WfzEDe7qXigbG75ufESqsg,5,"Whenever  we go back to my other home away from home (Napa Valley) Virgin America Airlines is our choice. Comfortable seats, great staff, and your own little entertainment monitor in front of you!

another cool thing is that they will allow you on an earlier flight to your destination if the flight is not full, and only if you have carry on luggage. Smooth flight and great service. Nuff said!......ALOHA!!!

2012-07-09,Virgin America,AMUzCaXsI_ca7C9TjSL3UQ,5,"I consider myself a frequent flier and Virgin really exceed my expectations today.

I was flying from LAS to SFO.

First I made a ticketing mistake. To my embarassment, my girlfriend was turned away at security by the TSA. VA really went above and beyond to fix my error at no expense to me. Megan, Shirley and Vanessa at the check-in desk was cheerful and expedient. Completely opposite to what most expectations would be of airline staff. This blew me away.

Our flight was then delayed an hour due to typical SFO weather. It was a completely full flight and many groans were heard. When we finally pushed off, SFO FAA slapped us with another 2 hour delay. The captain apologized, told us we'd need to deplane. But then, he was like wait... Virgin headquarter's operators were trying to contact the FAA to see if they could get us a shorter delay. 20 minutes later we were in the air.

What an enjoyable experience despite all that went wrong. All I could have asked for and more."
2012-10-21,Virgin America,QuIroKm7Qsk2Vox2r2Xkjw,5,"Even though half of my flights have been delayed due to weather, Virgin has yet to disappoint me. I flew first class, which i recommend everyone to start doing.Unlimited alcohol, seats that recline, a bathroom with 5 feet,  a bunch of current movies to watch.My favorite thing so far is that i get to drink while the common people trudge towards the back.The look of hatred and jealousy always tastes so good. We were stuck on Friday during the playoffs with St Louis and were 3 hours late leaving the terminal. Virgin got another crew from a different plane to board the passengers so we could leave once the crew arrived from a different city, which had also been weather delayed. The substitute staff was cheerful and gracious, and stayed with us until the real staff showed up. They acted like friendly professionals who went above and beyond to make sure the customers were kept aware of the time delays and gave us regular updates. On my way back, they started boarding us very early, and we arrived back in SFO very early. I wish i could say that every other airline was like that, but it is rare.This is kinda what Jetblue used to be like.I now shlep all the way over to SFO to fly even though i live 10 minutes away from the Oakland airport.They are THAT good! A shout out to Kevin, who helped us in first class.He was really amazing. The other passengers in first class were trying to talk Kevin into coming to Vegas with them to hang out. Thats how awesome the staff at Virgin America is."
2012-10-25,Virgin America,wGFB2ArisdJf0_FODHWEyg,5,"What Great customer service! 

Ok this is what happened.... My flight to sf was delayed so I was leisurely walking to my gate. I went to the gate where there was a San Francisco flight boarding but it actually was not mine. This was the previous sf flight delayed until now. I found out when I tried to check in, they said I was checking in for the wrong flight. Ok, fine.

I went to my actual gate and found out that my flight was delayed for the next three hours! I don't think so, so I took off back to the other gate and asked nicely if they had room. And the agents went to the computer, clicked a couple of buttons and presto chango, I was on! 

Thanks Virgin America!

Please also know the plane is cool, updated, all seats have the mini TVS and the crew are funny."

Love how they have tv, games and music on board, however it sucks when it does't work.  Their prices are reasonable for airfare.  The only thing I don't like is the headphones cost about $2 but sometimes they waive the fee and let people have them for the flight.  My last flight they did that until I walked up and the guy told me to drop $2 in the bin...I looked at him and said ""then you might want to tell the 10 other people that got them for free to come back and drop $2 each as well.""  I understand they did that as a courtesy but if you don't extend it to all your passengers then don't offer it at all....but I still give them 5 stars because I prefer to flight Virgin America over any other airlines."

They make traveling easier than I've experienced in the US in over 15 years. No hoops to jump through, no silly fee games no cattle calls, just good ol' simple, common sense business practices. And, they actually clean the plane after each flight. How nice to see staff come onboard to sanitize! Planes are a breeding ground for germs and many planes (on other airlines) fly all day without anyone touching the restrooms let alone sanitizing them. Virgin America, you will be my first choice in all future flights. You're amazing and such a breath of fresh air in the down and dirty airline industry."

First of all, I got to the terminal at 7:00pm on a Friday night and no car lines to deal with, walked right in, checked my bag, through security, and at my gate in less than 15 minutes.  Seats are assigned, so I had an exit row with extra leg room (although the regular rows are spacious, too) and a TV with free (very) recent movies, TV, music, games, and an option to order snacks and drinks that are delivered to your seat throughout the flight.  I didn't order anything on my flight from Vegas to San Francisco, but during the leg from SFO to Washington, DC, I did have the protein box with almonds, multi-grain crackers, hummus, and tuna, plus chocolate chip cookies, and 2 bottles of Honest Tea--I felt like ordering one of everything on their menu, which is A LOT, but didn't want to seem too greedy.  I am, after all, going back home on the same airline, so I get another chance tomorrow.  I will be flying Virgin America whenever I can from now on."

I also loved that we left on time and landed before time a lot of airlines take for ever to leave the gates and I wont mention any names lol . I enjoyed everything about virgin and hope to continue using them all the time . They have so many free channels and even have free games to play also a radio and you can also watch movies or even TV shows for a small fee .I like that they do a funny safety video instead of watching the flight attendant do it . they make flying a little fun and enjoyable . if you get a chance try them best airline by far keep up the good work
2013-03-08,Virgin America,0SrX7WY0LPz2IuntYuwaSg,5,"VIRGIN AMERICA RULES!!!

I can't say enough good things about Virgin.  From the cheap prices that we got on tickets to Vegas, to the extremely comfortable seats with the movable headrests.  This company is awesome!!!  

When we were leaving Las Vegas we had to drop the rental car off by 4 in the afternoon.and our flight was at 6:45.  At the Virgin Counter there was no line and Ronnie was there to help us.  Ronnie had a smile on his face and he was an great help.  

We asked if we could get on an earlier flight and we were hoping but thought it wouldn't actually happen.  Ronnie told us that it wouldn't be a problem and we were going to be able to get on the next flight leaving at 4:55.  WE WERE SO HAPPY, THANKS RONNIE!  

He also told us that any time you fly with Virgin you can always get on the next earlier flight for free or an even earlier one and that would cost an extra twenty or twenty five bucks."
2013-03-12,Virgin America,72DYnP_JHm3jLWwfpkxtDQ,3,"I think Virgin America has lost some of its pizzazz.  The colored lighting no longer wows me.  On our trip from NYC to LAS the tvs barely worked.  I was really disappointed and also very bored as a result.  They didn't apologize or anything and it seemed universal so it makes me think that the tvs are just not the same as JetBlue.  Which also makes me prefer JetBlue.  Which also, coincidentally, is what we flew back to NYC from LAS.  Also, the bathrooms were gross and the flight attendant made me wait for a few minutes before using it so he could clean it and STILL it was disgusting.  Argh."
2013-04-07,Virgin America,N6Jf4PUOPvDpJXMTLK03cg,5,"Boy do I love traveling...boy do I love high rollin when I travel as much as my bank account will afford...and boy do I love feeling like a high roller without emptying my wallet! Found it! Found it with Virgin America on my trip to Vegas a few weeks back. I did two types of flights as well....going was in Main Cabin and coming back I upgraded to Main Cabin Select, so I'll give a review of both.

I must say that I've always loved Richard Branson. My aunt has lived in London the last 50 years so whenever I head over, I usually try to fly Virgin cause I love all their fun little goodies they include, like fun games, good food and great vibe in flight. Like you're hanging with the cool kids at school. So flying Virgin America was a no brainer to me and I'm happy to say, Branson has done a great job in the domestic arena impressing the Yanks. Boarding is fairly easy in JKF and getting settled was quick. The in flight crew was friendly and helpful finding homes for our carry ons with no attitude. One thing I love is being able to order what you want on the screen in front....and you pay as you go! The selection of healthy options were nice as well as I opted for a protein plate with grilled chicken breast, hummus and whole wheat pita.  Simple but filling. The cool decor is nice as well, with purple and blue lighting and the fact that they keep the plane dark the whole time was a nice treat in case you wanted to sleep to prep for the Big Weekend in Vegas. Flight was easy peasy and I was able to get WIFI on the plane to get through all my work emails before landing so I could truly start my vacation DONE with work. 

On the way back, I decided to treat myself to the Main Cabin Select upgrade option and boy was it worth it! The first row, right behind First Class is for Main Cabin Select and it was barely filled! You are able to board after First Class and the leg room was so big, I'm 5'5"" and was able to stretch my legs out completely. Then the service begins with the flight attendant asking me to just order whatever I wanted as it was all free as well as the all of the movies and entertainment. Then he added, may I start you with a cocktail? That's music to my ears. So I ordered a tequila on the rocks with lime and he delivered it poured and with an extra tequila in case I was ready faster than he was able to get back to me. Hooray!!

After that I settled in, ordered a movie, ordered some snacks and relaxed on my way back to NY feeling like a little Queen.  Great service continued throughout the flight, complimentary headsets, food, booze and entertainment. What more could this traveler ask for? Oh yeah, getting off the flight fast. Yep, did that, right after First Class. 

Overall, you can't go wrong in either cabin on Virgin America. Great airline who is giving the others a run for their money."
2013-05-07,Virgin America,qttPwFxBQHpYBSMcA8fL4w,1,"Very disappointed!  We flew from LAX to Las Vegas.  Our flight to Las Vegas was delayed 2 hours due to ""mechanical problems"".  I accept that happens every know and then so no big deal.  On the way back, the flight was delayed 2 hours, again.  I was told, again, that it was mechanical problems.  How many planes do you have with mechanical problems??  I called customer service because I had to be home promptly and was told that the delay was due to weather - what?  Thought it was mechanical problems.  Asked if I would be refunded my fare if I decided to drive home because I could not be home as late as my new departure would put me at.  
I was told no refund but they would agree to waive the $100.00. cancellation fee. Horrible customer service and flight attendants all had attitude.  When we landed in LAX the pilot apologized for the delay and told us that all flights had been delayed that day - great!"
2013-05-19,Virgin America,evr6Pccn_sIOtbo_7KETWA,5,"I'm beginning to NOT hate traveling by air so much anymore. Actually on Virgin, it was downright enjoyable. For a few bucks more we upgraded our seats and had the best flights I can remember. For the upgrade you get free checked bags, roomier seats, and all of the food and drink you want and can order right from the seat on the headrest in front of you at no charge. The flight attendants were all super friendly and came with anything you needed. I had a fresh veggie wrap that was better than most restaurants and a turkey sandwich that was good as well. With free on demand movies and a deep comfortable seat- who could ask for anything more. If you have to fly and don't want to be treated like cattle, then this is the airline for you. In an age where some other airlines nickel and dime you for just about everything, this was a breath of fresh air. Keep up the good work!"

The interview got pushed forward one day and I needed to get there. They were going to charge me an extra $600 to move my $200 ticket forward one day. I was like naw and I drove there instead, spending less than $100 both ways. So then I call today to redeem my $200 credit and boom they want $140 to redeem the credit plus whatever the change is in airfare. WTF?! How many fees can you possibly charge ya damn crooks. So it's going to be cheaper for me just to not even do anything with the $200 credit. Meanwhile their big-head CEO is floating around in space talking about how great Virgin is. I have never spent the time to write a bad review about anything or anyone because normally it does no good, but people need to be warned about this shady company.

PEACE!"
2013-10-06,Virgin America,vtRfGJ75mz1lxr0LtQkjCw,4,"Virgin on Virgin America Airlines no more.

Virgin is one of the few airlines that has a ton of 4+ Stars.  After flying the friendly skies with them, I agree. Virgin Airlines is breath of fresh air compared to my usual Southwest Airlines.  There's more leg room, plenty of space for luggage, seats & your toys, comfortable seating, and the highlight for me...TV.  It's not DIRECTV, but it's free and you can watch the news, football, ESPN, or get caught up on your soaps while heading to your next destination. If there's an issue that I have with Virgin, it's that bags don't fly free like Southwest. 

PS:  Upon landing, I love how they inform the passengers which baggage claim to go to.  Southwest doesn't do this.


YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (441/500)"
2013-10-08,Virgin America,UPUQ5EX3UeqTvxiXuPP2JQ,5,"By far the best airline ever. Friendly staff. Extremely clean and I love the purple disco lights and upbeat music. Watched tv the entire time with plenty of leg room which made the time fly, literally."
2013-12-26,Virgin America,1An5qEVx_FTpZDfBst7TmA,5,"I was really pleased with flying Southwest for a long time mainly for their pricing but after discovering great prices with Virgin I have no problem switching.

The aircraft's interior is illuminated by neon lights and offers comfy seats with a personal screen which offers many entertainment options. You can also hand hold the remote. 

I do prefer to fly into Oakland International only cause it is a more direct drive home and Virgin unfortunately does not fly into this airport but landing in San Francisco International has its advantages too. It is in my opinion one of the most beautiful airport.

The only annoying thing is that you can become a member accruing points with each flight but they do not issue an official card so you really have to keep the number in a safekeeping place.   The service has always been great and so far smooth landings!"
2014-01-13,Virgin America,zfDWtQWgPAEtLburNYziJQ,4,"John F. Kennedy airport has under gone quite a facelift over the past ten years and as a semi frequent flyer, I try to limit my time there by looking to other airports to depart from and arrive at, as its quite typically a complete mad house.

Once out of the cab I hoped to get checked in as soon and as painless as possible, so I headed for the counter with this hope and was quite thrilled with the overall experience. My check in was as easy as pie and the counter person was super friendly and  I was off with boarding pass in hand ready to take to the skies.
Once aboard and my gear was properly stowed away I sat to take in the unique pink and blue hues that illuminated the cabin. 

The screen mounted on the seat in front went by the name RED, which is probably an acronym for something which I must have missed. The user interface is super clean and easy to navigate, so scrolling through the On Demand channel, regular television channels which picks up national and local channels as well and a music channel. 
Ordering food or drinks is a breeze as you just enter the seat number of whom you are ordering for, if not yourself, add to cart and checkout. You can swipe the card right on the monitor that you are viewing your channels on and within a few very short moments your order arrives.

Very enjoyable flying experience from beginning to end, putting Virgin America on the top of my list of air carriers I hope to travel with on a more frequent basis"

With fuscia lighting, low-key flight attendants and ever-changing, hip safety videos, I'm never disappointed flying Virgin. I really enjoyed the seat-to-seat chat you could do on your screen as well as the free in-flight wifi, satellite TV, excellent music choices (you can even create your own playlist!) on my short-a## flight from SF to Vegas.

I am not sure if it is because I have been so scarred by flying United before and was on the flight from hell, but my experience with Virgin was just lovely.  We had a flight from LAX to Vegas and there was just a 30 min delay due to weather conditions.  30 minutes was not a big deal to us and all the workers were so personable and friendly.  I love the lights inside the plane and their safety video is so entertaining.  I actually watched it! haha For our hour flight, they even offered water, wine, and beer for free.  I love the screens on the chairs and you can send drinks to someone at another seat or even a message.  Pretty cool! On our flight back, our friends that did not fly Virgin had a bunch of delays, but Virgin actually got us back early.  Great experience! I want to fly Virgin forever! :)"
2014-03-08,Virgin America,VDlpUEUoXFjiF_RQw9Mmjw,5,"Hands down the best domestic airline- if they fly the route you are looking for book it. If they don't- consider flying somewhere else instead. 

The planes- easily the nicest planes for domestic flights. Seats are roomier, nicer (leather) and each seat gets its own TV and video games- and this is in economy. Also you can order food and drinks to your seat through the touch screen- no need to ring the annoying call button. The planes are lighted inside like a disco in purple and neon pink. You can often upgrade to main cabin elite or first class for cheap the day of your flight if they aren't booked. There are also electrical outlets which are sweet on coast to coast flights. 

The staff- are always super nice and generally quite attractive to boot. Even the people at the check in counter who usually at other airlines are pretty grumpy are always nice, efficient, and professional. I can't stress enough that this is lightyears ahead of other airlines like southwest/airtran, delta, american etc. 

Prices- the kicker is you can often find flights cheaper than on other airlines which is mind boggling considering how much better Virgin is."
2014-03-29,Virgin America,gkr_DCPAAjYZG9yQQVby9g,4,"Flew with Virgin America on Wednesday, March 26th from Vegas to SFO. It was my first time flying with them.

1) Pink lights everyone when you step onto the plane :P
2) They have TVs! (I didn't have headphones with me so I watched tv with no sound haha). You can watch tv, listen to music, order food/drinks, view the map.
3) They give you drinks! (I accidentally ordered from the TV and there was a flight attendant already moving down the aisle, asking what you want to drink).
4) Comfy seats and nice flight attendants"
2014-04-19,Virgin America,ZzqaEkGceexoOt1HCngaQA,5,"I've flown with Virgin America at least time times and have had nothing short of a positive experience each time.  Far and away my favorite airline.   

Here's a few of the reasons I love Virgin America, in no particular order.   I'm just crossing my fingers that with the Delta merger their quality stays. 

1.) Group Reservations.  I have booked trips from SF to DC  on VA for five consecutive years for a group of 10 students + myself.   Their group reservation folks are super responsive and really easy to work with.

2.) Price.  Each time I have flown with Virgin, they have been very competitive... at or near the least expensive, while offering a far superior quality.   

3.) Airport staff.  When flying with kids, they have always shown tremendous respect and kindness to them... treating them with dignity.   

4.) Flight crew.  Kind, professional, and responsive, without exception.   

5.) Policies.  They don't try to take advantage of you when there is a mishap.   For the first time in my life I missed a flight.   They offered me free standby on the next flight or $35 to have a guaranteed seat.  They were empathetic to my situation, not annoyed by my error.   

6.) In-flight entertainment/WiFi;    I love the music selection and making a playlist for the flight.   The WiFi is reasonably priced and reliable.   Their are 3-prong plugs that work for my laptop in coach.

7.) Leg room:  I'm 6'3"" and I am comfortable in coach.  

8.) The ambiance, hipness, and their safety video... I'll leave other reviewers to offer up details about this."
2014-05-04,Virgin America,7vQ4vJfgDIAmWAI5aC0jLA,5,"After my last trip with southwest I was hesitant about taking a plane anywhere.  I was really impressed with Virgin - inexpensive ticket, clean plane, and courteous stewardess - without a massive amount of perfume and attitude - check in luggage $25, free carry on and free beer, wine, and water.   
Great experience!!"
2014-06-15,Virgin America,jN4nzBGL10bqX8JZEPwaXg,5,"I was only on the plane for one hour but i wished the flight was longer. In 2013, I flew from Las Vegas to LAX for less than $100.  I wished the flight was longer.  

What's so awesome about this airline?
-neon pink cabin lights
-prices are similar to JetBlue and Delta
-sometimes awesome full sized headphones are provided.
-you can order food and drinks through the in-flight entertainment system.

Verdict: if you got a choice and are flying within the US, then being with a Virgin ain't so bad."
2014-06-15,Virgin America,hFAH4E5HTmu7Q_o8DcOrEg,5,"Virgin is just plain great. Compare to United, American, or Delta....and there is no comparison!

Round trip to vegas $170 was really good.

Once again Virgin America for the win!"

But when my husband & I flew Virgin America for the first time, we just couldn't believe how wonderful ALL personnel was; from the ticket agents to the flight attendants, etc.  The two terminals that we were in (Las Vegas & San Francisco) were awesome.  Everyone at Virgin were so attentive and friendly.  The next place we are going wherever that is will be with Virgin America !!!!!! 
BYE, BYE United."
2014-07-06,Virgin America,XRgkAwuaaFCw_CJ_UoExew,4,Flights were on time. No orange juice coming back from la.  Long wait to get on plane in Boston and no restaurant. We liked the video to instruct us on safety.

I wish we had Virgin in Hawaii, I would make them my primary airlines. I was only flying from Vegas to L.A. so I wasn't on there for long but I wish I could of taken advantage of their entertainment system. They did offer Wine or Water.

She was 'helping' me, made me filled out all these documents, and then 'lied' that she did not promise to call after I signed. Escalation to manager was denied.
WTF.
It was ridiculous.

Luckily, another staff showed up AFTER me waiting/talking/arguing for a hour or so. She promised to call, and gave me a number in case I want to check the second day.

They found it, and the second lady called the second day. Hence the 2 stars. But then, still, if you are a small company, and you want to grow, you better work hard, if not harder than everyone."
2009-12-05,Frontier Airlines,6PT8-YzeK0NehWgNZFVAbw,4,"I almost miss my flights on Frontier because they always seem to start boarding earlier than other airlines. This can be inconvenient but it can also be great to arrive at the destination earlier. 

I did have some confusion on my last flight. I checked a carry-on bag at the gate but I forgot to provide my final destination to the flight attendant who also failed to ask. My bag almost continued with the plane into Indy even though I was going to Phoenix, but we were able to sort it out without losing a bag.

Comfort and amenities are a grade or two above Southwest, but Frontier does charge for checked baggage."
2009-12-06,Frontier Airlines,K7m913Lbmq5eysoVQrJUdg,4,"Frontier service is usually fairly good.  I enjoy the designs on their planes as well, and their hub in Denver is convenient for a lot of routes.  I wish prices were a little more competitive with Southwest."

I fly every month usually on United or AA.

On my way to Denver, CO:
Pilot and crew were fun, engaged, and gave us helpful updates.
Pretty comfy despite the fact that the plane was almost full.
We arrived early 15 min early.

""ladies and gentlemen we are 15 min early to Denver, please keep this in mind when we're running 15 min late"" -- pilot.

On the way back to Phoenix from Denver:
SUCKed.

My group bought 4 tickets thru Expedia, prepaid for them.
One of our kids got put on standby.
Three of us were seated in the 8,9,10 rows while the poor standby kid got a seat in the 23 sections.
What pissed me off was that they had tons of empty seats.

Minor issue: My seatback did not tilt back, it was stuck.
The TV screen in front of me could not be turn off (other ppl's screens could be turned off),

Major issue: they served me a *SOILED BEVERAGE*
It had clearly gone bad. Toxicity and Sourness radiated in my mouth on the first sip.

I am so turned off after this one experience that I will never fly this airline again unless all other airlines go out of business (which the gov't will prolly bail them out of anyways)  :/"
2011-02-16,Frontier Airlines,FoRAPM6_XGo0jLmTdBa7iw,3,"I think sometimes it's amusing how when I go to talk to the ticket counter workers (in Denver) and they are bracing to tell me their standard lines about how they can't do anything for me so sorry blah blah blah . . . and then they see on my ticket that I am a member of the Ascent club. 

Oh! Those 6 little letters!

Yes, I have elite frequent flier status on Frontier, thanks to bi-locating between Denver and Phoenix. For the most part I have had very little to complain about with Frontier. I have even less to complain about these days with my Ascent club, which gets me 2 free checked bags, stretch seating, free TV, late check-in, a few other things. It's good to be Ascent club.

For anyone not so blessed. Southwest is usually is the better value if you are checking a bag or two."
2011-08-16,Frontier Airlines,Zl5qa-3zUxSCLBFyHBS1UQ,1,"WARNING!!!!!! My recommendation is to run, not walk, from Frontier Airlines to the nearest Southwest Airline counter.

2011-11-17,Frontier Airlines,a0lCu-j2Sk_kHQsZi_eNgw,4,"They've gotten better and better for me in the time since this review was written. 

My last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one.

I think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you aren't Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there it's a good value. When I've had to fly Southwest or USAir I've been disappointed in comparison."

The flights keep changing ...  direct flights be come crack of dawn connection flights (not good considering my little sister  and dad have not ever flown before!), and each time I try to call and clarify things I get nothing but more confusion and smack talk.  Then I attempted to add my cousin's flight to the mix - big mistake!  The online portal is an ABSOLUTE MESS just like the customer service line I've had to call four times now.  I didn't write down my cousin's locator because I made the mistake of thinking they would actually get the emailed confirm sent!  When I called back they couldn't even find her by name ... I had to pull up my credit card statement to prove they charged me for it and in the mean time got nothing but smack talk from the Rep.  Not cool, not cool at all.  I have many, many years more travel coordination to do, it definitely will not involve Frontier."

Don't book with this airline unless you are extremely flexible with your flight times.  I booked FOUR flights on this airline and every time I get a minimum of THREE time changes.  I had to cancel two because the times were just not going to work.  They gave me a refund, that was the only good part...I didn't have to fight for the refund.  They send you emails just telling you matter of factly, oh by the way your flight has been pushed back 3 hours.  I will never use this airline again!

I am already questioning my decision to fly Frontier even BEFORE I step on the plane. I've seen more interactive statues than the people who didn't assist me today. I was treated like an inconvenience rather than a customer."

I usually fly USair but someone else booked my flight.
I almost always have to gate check my bag because I'm usually the last one on,  but since I volunteered my bag they let me board first. (That's a first for me!)
The seats were nice and the service seemed fast (granted it was a smaller plane.ha.)
I think I would still choose US just because of what I've heard about the flight time changes. That would mess me up, but no problems this time!"

When I tried to book online, the system would not take my voucher number and wanted to charge me full price. When I called customer service and explained my problem, Alicia was friendly and professionally handled my reservations with ease. 

3 of the 4 legs of my trip were on time, with the last leg to Phoenix from Denver only 1/2 hour late due to a late arrival from Milwaukee. Because of the delay, we got free TV. One other leg gave us free TV because the movies weren't available. 

The coffee is good, the choice of beverages is good,  and the crew's service is adequate but not exceptional.

If I continue to fly Frontier it will be because it flies into Akron-Canton AIrport from Phoenix with only one stop in Denver....a better option for me instead of flying to Pittsburgh, Cleveland or Columbus."

I was super surprised at the leg and hip room you get on these planes.  There are TVs in the headrests (for purchase of course), free earbuds, and bev service and good snacks to purchase available. 

Fastest beverage service I have ever had, but the best part was the trip home. Frontier terminals aren't too crowded. The layover at the Denver airport was perfect (walked across the aisle of the terminal to our next gate) and asked for upgrade to exit row for the second leg, if they were available.  They usually cost and extra $40 for the added leg room, but the lady saw that we were pretty tall (I'm 5'10"") and I asked nicely. Hell my 7' step father could fit in the exit row!

TVs are free for the planes with the busted units or really short flights. Just depends.  Checking a bag was only $20. We will definitely use them again if their prices stay that competitive."

I booked a flight with them to Denver because it was the cheapest, but I did not know it would entail an 8 hour delay and ZERO notification of it until the scheduled time to take off.  They gave everyone 7 dollar lunch coupons which cover about half of a meal at the airport and were very nonchalant and not apologetic whatsoever. The staff is lazy and apathetic, telling customers they are being laid off in September and talking bad about the company that they work for.  No efforts were made by airport staff to help me out with rescheduling my flight so I called customer service who was slightly more helpful but still no solution or compensation was available.  This company is being run straight into the ground and As a frequent flyer I would not recommend them to anyone that has the choice of another airline."

After buying it, I read the many negative online reviews, so decided to build in extra time at Sky Harbor before my flight and lowered my expectations (and paid close attention to the number and size of my carry-on and personal bags- made sure I had room to fit my purse inside my suitcase so I could stowe my carry-on with books and computer at my feet.)  I ended up having 2 great, on-time flights, an easy connection, comfortable seats and an all-round satisfactory experience.  I fly often and like it when expectations and the experience are in sync."
2014-04-22,Frontier Airlines,7EDT6jLoVHOcD67egAlebw,5,"From the gate agents to the flight crew I truly feel that this airline puts the customer first which is very rare these days. I am a Denver resident and travel on Frontier once a week for business and have never had a lost bag. I have also rarely been late to my destination. Of course there are times when the plane departs late, but they are almost always uncontrollable circumstances such as weather that would effect safety and are out of the airlines control. 
      Frontier is also in transition to become a low cost carrier. Everything will be a la carte from carry on bags to seat assignment. But I think this is a good approach because you only have to buy what you are going to use. So if you are a light traveler it will be possible to get some really cheap air fare. Kind of the same approach as Spirit but the difference is MUCH better customer service.  Go Frontier!

Their staff is unhelpful and rude , taking satisfaction in denying service and help to their passengers. They don't offer you a standby  in case you could take your flight, they will ask for a fee to change your ticket, even if flight isn't half way full . Charges for carry one , soda ect . I wouldn't be surprised if soon  start charging passengers to use lavatory on their flights . 
It might be the only airlines employees I never seen smiling and being polite . I'm sure they train their employees .... Is there special class how to make passengers experience the worst possible ? Sure seems like it"

The last gate attendant when asked why we have no seat assignment when we had picked our seats. We were dismissed with"" you will get on this flight"". Surprisingly this is not what I asked and mentioned this to her. So with a sickeningly sweet smile said "" we do not guarantee seats "" 

So to me this says why use this airline if I can get a better flight from another where seats are not picked. 

Yes we got on the flight, but not sitting where we paid to sit, nor next to each other. 

Yes the flight was full and yes all of the first class was full when we bought the tickets.

Karen F. called my cell phone as soon as my bag that had been missing for 4 days and traveling the world arrived. She held it in the office and explained what happened. The office also locks up the bags here, unlike Logan Airport which leaves them out for anyone to take. 

When my other bag once lost, but now found was lost returning home, she was able to locate it within minutes. She provided a new claim ticket, indicated the bag would be delivered to my house the next day and if it wasn't there by a specific time, to call back. She also encourage me to call the corporate office and complain about the experience I had so far on the trip. When I mentioned my bag was lost for 4 days and I had to go buy clothes, she asked for the receipts. She wrote a reimbursement check for $500, which she said will be mailed to my home in 7-10 days.

I usually take the late night flight to Atlanta on a Boeing 757. The planes have always been clean, and (at least on the larger 757s) come with personal TVs! I am also a big fan of the snack choices they offer. Go with the cookies, trust me :).

Also, as I boarded, the plane had a little odd smell. Sure enough, they put food in the plane and let them spoil in 100+ heat for hours with no AC running while plane was getting repair. Best part was, they still have to fly that spoiled food for 5 hours to my destination. Niiiice. 

The only thing saved my temper was the FA and Captain - they were really awesome and funniest crews I've been flying with, and thanks to them, I got home in better mood...6 hours behind schedule."

I was forced to throw away Cologne, moisturizer, hair product and a couple other things because I didn't have a plastic bag to put them in. The grooming kit I've traveled with for the last four years (and never had an issue with) apparently isn't good enough for Delta. Even US Airways let me travel with my grooming kit, and they are Satan's airline. Delta: if you do anything worse than US Air, you're hitting an all time low.

They're also slow through security (wasting people's money takes time) and generally unfriendly. They are really the whole package.

This shit is why people hate flying. Eff you Delta, never again."

They let me on the plane phoenix to ohio fine but when it came time to go to rome they woudn't allow us on the plane. This was when the country just started using passports instead of birth certifigates but I was told a birth certifigate would be fine. So they decide not to tell us until Im STRANDED IN OHIO! We had to fly to atlanta to spend 1000 dollars on passports and by that time we missed out Cruise in Rome! 2. Decided to try them again. Stupid stupid..I was flying to Wisconsin from Philadelphia and needed to change my departure destination to San Diego. Okay, southwest would allow this. I even figured okay ill change the flight and just pay the difference. How about a change flight is 200 dollars! So I couldn't cancel it because I would lose 288 but if I changed it I would have 88 dollar credit! Are you people insane?! So I had no other option but to change it so I was on the phone and quoted 350 Additional. Dam you Delta. Fine, I told them I would call back in a minute just to confirm with a friend of mine who was flying with me. Called back it went up another 200 dollars! They don't be sorry but no can do! So I ended up paying almost 700 dollars for one coach seat. 3. Coming home from this trip they delayed my plane 4 times so I ended up waiting 4 1/2 hours in the airport. When I asked them what where they gonna do for me they gave me 7 dollar food voucher and said sorry. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? WILL NEVER EVER FLY WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!! HORRIBLE DON'T DO IT!!!"

Of course, they're not a main carrier in this airport, but because they're a major carrier and so ubiquitous across the U. S. of A. they don't get treated like a redheaded stephchild here like other carriers.

I didn't check bags this time, but in occasions past they haven't had any problems with them. Gate agents are just fine--somewhat robotic but in the efficient way. That's not mean to be a backhanded compliment, they just do the same thing over and over and I haven't had any issues with them.

Also, disclaimer, this isn't a ""grumpy"" review, the service is fine and Im not mad at anyone, this is data driven around the comparative offerings. (Delta operates about 5-6 gates here in PHX). The situation is not good:

- One restroom with a tiny entrance and exit, always crowded in there and you bump elbows coming in/out
- Food: Wendy's and a tired ""Cantina""
- No bookstore
- No soda stop/drink stop
- No coffee store
- No bakery
- Gross worn out carpets
- Crowded wait areas with few seats

2009-09-01,Mesa Air Group,kMAyUX0cyC59u-RTG0kUmw,1,"This review pertains to their subsidiary airline, ""Go!"" in the Hawaiian islands. Don't Fly Go!
Wow! I have never run into a less competent airline. These people couldn't run a bicycle-rickshaw taxi service, let alone an airline. If you're spending a lot of money to come and enjoy the islands, don't do what I've done, which is book interisland flights through go. They'll be at least an hour late most of the time. However, today one flight left 12 minutes early, and so I missed my connection. I watched my aircraft pull away as I was arriving on another - they couldn't hold it for two minutes. Why?
Because they don't care. At all! Not even a little. No apology for allowing an aircraft to leave 12 minutes early, consigning me to an later flight. This is, fortunately, the last flight I've booked with Go, and I will never, ever book another flight with them, or with any other Mesa Air Group airline."
2014-02-01,Mesa Air Group,YGnZBtsZgqjdxwb7u54dGg,1,"Horrible airlines that constantly reschedules flights due to so called ""maintenance"" which I believe is their inability to fill a flight so therefore they use the maintenance excuse to bump passengers to the next scheduled flight which could be several hours out."

Unfortunately, I just had a terrible experience.  On 3/17/14 they announced they are cancelling all flights within Hawaii, but they never emailed about this (which could have easily been done for every affected customer that day), and didn't call me to discuss it until 3/29 (less than 2 weeks before our scheduled flight) to inform us that we only had 2 options: get rescheduled to a Hawaiian Airlines flight 6hrs later than we originally planned, or receive a refund to buy tickets on a different airline (of course by now the prices of said tickets were sky high).

The part that really irked me is that Hawaiian Air had seats available in flights that were almost at the exact same time as our original flight, but Go/Mesa refused to reschedule us to one of those flights because they said they couldn't afford it.  

That's inexcusable, and the reason why I'll never fly with Mesa Air again, if I can avoid it!"

You get your boarding pass from the Kiosk, with your bags, then you wait in a VERY crowded space to check your bag. If you have to see an agent for unaccompanied minors or routing changes, you go into another line and wait until there are no bags to check.  This is about as friendly as Spirit Airlines where they don't care about their passengers.

2012-01-29,JetBlue,R1gzlZnXDicybAkIY1f5ZQ,3,My first time flying on Jetblue occurred a few weeks ago when I flew out to Vegas on business.  The prices for flights were great deals.  The flight attendants were friendly.  The plane was nice and I liked the fact that each seat had it's own TV monitor so that you can watch shows during the flight even though I was flying from Long Beach to Las Vegas.  Jetblue is the airline I plan to fly with on future trips.  The only thing that I had a complaint was the my flights were delayed going to and coming back from Las Vegas.

2012-08-07,JetBlue,T_U6bsUJwh6YhzQ9tARIzg,3,Perfectly fine terminals. Small but clean and well staffed. Love Jet Blue.
2012-08-09,JetBlue,S5k-zR-ep5xYJc72mr0bYQ,3,"Here are the things I've learned flying JetBlue for the past five years.

1. They are THE ONLY airline with nonstop flights from Las Vegas to Boston (and I mean Logan Airport in Boston. Not TF Green (RI) or Manchester (NH). The only other one is SouthWest that fly into Manchester.

2. Their point system for their frequent flyer program called TrueBlue used to build up super fast. Now not so much, can't tell if it's because of their new point system or that flying costs more now. Either way they have done away with their expiration of points that use to happen if you didn't fly for a full calendar year.

3. In the summer your flight will most likely be delayed because of heavy storms in the southeast US since their planes seem to work off of a triangle cycle. For instance, my flight back to Las Vegas from Boston was delayed because the plane was coming up from South Carolina which was experiencing a tropical storm. Also, they seem to rely heavily on their flights coming in on time as I have had flights delayed because the stewards that came in on a different plane were assigned to ours, and that incoming plane was delayed.

4a. Love the fact that they had LCD screens in every seat with DirecTV and Sirius/XM radio, but the screens are seriously outdated and you can't plug in your media player in to watch movies on the screen (USB or Video in). I've been told by a JetBlue associate newer planes they are getting have USB and power adapters, but not in all seats (that's actually pretty typical, for instance Air Canada doesn't have power plugs at the window seats) along with in-flight wireless internet.

4b. Because the LCD screens are outdated, the pay movies aren't shown in HD, so you get to spend $5 on watching a movie on a screen with the resolution detail that is less than a hand held device. The pilots seem to have become more stingy in their free movie comps. A late takeoff or small turbulence was enough to get the pilot to turn on free movies. Now it doesn't seem to happen at all :(

5. If you live in Las Vegas, or any other city on the west coast, your choice for destinations to redeem your JetBlue points are really limited since they concentrate all of their business out of NY and Boston. Want to go to the Caribbean? You're connecting in NY. Want to visit family in Chicago? You're connecting in NY. A vacation in Florida? You have a choice: connect in NY or connect in Boston. In other words: You're going east to go west, and going north to go south. It's a lot of flying and not worth the time or stress.

6a. They seem to have some partnerships with a few airlines, but usually to fill in service gaps for the other airlines, and mostly out of NY and, to a smaller degree, Boston. I want to fly to San Diego, JetBlue doesn't fly there. American Airlines does, too bad I can't build up JetBlue points by using American Airlines, but I can build up American Airline points on some JetBlue flights. Bottom line is if you travel a lot from LAS to major cities on the west coast then hang on to your SouthWest Rapid Rewards Visa card if you got one.

6b. This one sided partnership is really frustrating since they brag about their partnerships with so many airlines, especially international ones, but is of little or no use to us in America. Especially if you're not in NY. These partnerships again only seem to serve as service fillers for international customers from other airlines who need to fly from NYC to Buffalo, or Boston to Cape Cop, or another destination that doesn't get that much air traffic.

7. Love, love, love that JetBlue is in the new Terminal (3) at LAS. Terminal 1 was turning into such a mad house."
2012-10-25,JetBlue,79mU3K3rvDa7iw-e8mEBxg,4,"Both of my flights left on time or early and we landed early on both accounts!!!!  This never happens!  

I'm a nervous flier, even though I fly a lot, and I really liked the communication from the pilots to the passengers about what was going on.  On the way to NYC they pointed out that if you were on the right hand side of the plane you got a great view of the Grand Canyon.  We had a bit of turbulence and the pilot came on explained he had talked to mission control and it was going to last about 5-10 mins.  He then told us to sit back relax, order a drink, and enjoy our flight.

The only thing that would've made this review 5 stars is if we got faster beverage service. I swear it's like they wait an hour now before they even start and they do the snack pack service first. I'd prefer they have a beverage ordering system through their TVs, like Virgin does, as well as, snack pack ordering there too. So we can order within the first 10 mins of the flight and the flight attendants can start distribution of our drinks ASAP!"

2013-03-24,JetBlue,a4V1b3b41DNo6eidl2HHeA,1,"I will never fly with JetBlue again. Each time I have flown with them, there was some arbitrary reason for the plane not functioning correctly. 

My first awful experience was last July 2012 when I was taking a flight from Vegas back to Long Beach. We boarded, sat on the plane which was stuffy and had no air circulation for an hour until we were told to deplane. Then 20 minutes later we got back on, sat inside the sweat box once again for another half an hour, and then had to deplane again only to be told the plane was broken and we wouldn't have another flight out until 3 hours later. To compensate, we were given a 15$ meal voucher and later on a JetBlue credit of 75$ (significantly lower than the price I paid for the ticket)

Now I am sitting in the Vegas airport since my 7am flight, which costed 270$, was cancelled because some light was broken in the plane. Once again, everyone was given a cheap 8$ meal voucher and told we wouldn't know anything for at least an hour. Finally they announced the flight was cancelled, which then turned into mass confusion amongst all passengers as the JetBlue agents do not clearly explain on the loud speaker what we should all do.  Next, we are told to go out to the JetBlue ticketing area to book a different flight, only to be informed that the only available flight left will be at 6:22 pm. The rude agent said we could either book that flight or receive a 150$ voucher and figure out what to do with it....that is unacceptable, the plane ticket was 270$ and who the hell would want a JetBlue voucher after having to deal with their rude people and planes that constantly have problems. Customers deserve a full refund back to their credit cards, not credit to use for another JetBlue flight. Now I will be spending 12 hours in the airport as I wait for another JetBlue plane. 

This is the absolute last time I will book with JetBlue. It is worth paying a higher price for another airline that doesn't consistently royally screw up. 
NEVER AGAIN."

The rescheduled flight wasn't set to leave until three whole days later! Holy moly, i had to get back to work! That being said, they made no attempt to accommodate me or pay for the inconvenience. No hotel, no taxi voucher or nothing. They did offer a refund if I didn't want to take the ridiculous flight that was leaving three days later. I think you can figure out the choice I made. The heavens were looking over me that day and I managed to nab a late flight leaving to LAX 8+ hours later that evening. 

I swore never again to fly JetBlue but when February came around, I had to make reservations for a business trip and because my Amex preferred airline was JetBlue, I just took the leap of faith. I flew out of long beach with no hassle but when it came time to flying back home, trouble was brewing yet again. 
This time, the flight gate was changed last minute without any changes made on the overhead flight monitors. I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart. To add insult to injury, they stated the 5pm flight was delayed until 7pm for maintenance issues. 2 hours later, they dropped the bomb on us and said the flight was cancelled. I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding ""No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight"" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with ""No""  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague. Horrible service, no regard or consideration whatsoever for their customers and completely unreliable."
2010-03-12,US Airways,AID2VFdPSXYvSIBL02zcuw,1,"Dear US Airways,

YOU SUCK!  If I could give you 0 stars, I would.  I only chose your airline from Expedia because it was the cheapest one which brought me from Las Vegas to San Francisco.

First off, my flight from LAS to SFO on March 7, 2010 was delayed 2 hours.  Upon arriving to your A5 gate, your screens which usually tell your flight number and departure time was not working.  What does a person do to find out the departure time?  Ask a representative!  Her response was ""uhh...whenever the plane gets here, the people deboard, we clean and then everyone gets on"".  Ummm...really?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to find that out!  Your customer service SUCKS!  

I purposely don't check in luggage if I'm gone only a couple of days because you are not Southwest, you are not free.  Apparently, they announce that we're on a smaller plane and the plane cannot accommodate roller luggage, but we can leave them on at the gate and they will check in the luggage at no charge.  Instead of picking up our luggage at the carousels once we got back to SFO, we had to wait in the FREEZING tunnel area once we got off the plane.

Your tiny plane (a row of two seats on each side) is very unaccommodating.  The lady who sat next to me was not fat, yet her elbow constantly kept going into the side of my arms because we have to sit on the plane like sardines.  You seats are horribly hard and I think I feel the support bar, please upgrade your cushions.

We were served one drink.  No prezels.  No peanuts.  You want food? You need to buy it.  

US Airways, unless you pay me to ride on another one of your aircrafts, I will not be flying with you again.  I'd rather pay $20-30 extra and sit in comfort on another airline."
2010-05-06,US Airways,PNzM-GZuq4LKoXl9kldD4g,2,"Our flight was canceled because the airline failed in replacing the pilot. The pilot who was supposed to fill in to fly our flight refused to do so. It shows how poorly the airline manages the resource. The pilots must be pushed to work to their limit so that they cannot take another flight. 

Also they canceled the flight after they delayed it for 2 and half hours. When we were handled for an over-night accommodation, there was only a person at the ticket counter to re-book our flights and accommodations. They eventually added more people to help the process, but it took a looooooooooooooong time for us to get out of the airport. Then we were sent to a cheap and uncomfortable motel.

The next morning, we found we had been re-booked to the same canceled flight of the previous day. I don't know how their computer system allows the employee to be able to do something like it.

We were told there was a good chance to get on to the next morning flight. We went back to the airport only to find it was not true. Then they re-booked us to different flights, which we found out for ourselves. Finally they sent us to United and everything started to work out.

I added a star because I try to think positively that we had a few extra hours to see more in LV after we went through all of this incident."
2010-05-10,US Airways,J4Te8ZLUiMQc6Z36uOdhJA,1,"I have had the displeasure of dealing with US Airways for the past week. On May 2nd I flew with them and ended up having to check some things that I was not planning on. 
After a layover in Phoenix I reached my destination of Las Vegas where I discovered that my laptop, a bottle of vodka, as well as a few pairs of my underwear- were all taken.

Of course, these are all things that the airline will not cover, but the baggage claim woman had me file complaints anyway. She was incredibly helpful and sorry- I wish I had remembered her name. In the beginning we had thought it was TSA- as they had opened my bag and left a love note in it telling me so.  TSA actually viewed the security tapes so that they could clear them selves.

US Airways refuses. They keep trying to put the blame on everyone else, saying everything from their baggage handlers are outsourced, to it could have been someone just in the airport. Really?

With all that's been going on with airport security, DO NOT TELL ME THAT THESE PEOPLE AREN'T UNDER SOME SORT OF SURVEILLANCE. 

Also, all their call centers are outsourced, so while thats not really the issue they cant really give you any other information unless it pops up on their computer screen. At one point one of them even told me that my items had been located- which was obviously not the case.

Never fly with these people. Besides the fact that my stuff got stolen they charge for almost everything when you fly, and we never actually encountered a friendly worker on the plane."
2010-06-29,US Airways,2Ivcs2CaaqTNgBxEWLRA2Q,2,"I know that most airline reviews are usually negative, but US Airways don't even try to improve their service. I choose them because they were the cheapest price between Las Vegas and San Francisco. From now on I will pay the extra $20 dollars. We got to our gate with plenty of time and the representative told us the plane was going to arrive early. With 5 minutes before we were supposed to take off the plane had still not arrived. It took another 30 minutes for people to get off the plane and then another 30 minutes to board the plane. The reason for this is that the plane is tiny and they can't even accommodate carry-on's. The problem: they don't tell you this til your boarding. With one representative tagging each bag. When we get off the plane they just dump all the bags in the tunnel and its a free for all. Completely unorganized. Not worth the cheaper flight. Also no room on board and pissy flight attendants.

2010-08-20,US Airways,GlNdJNcPvKU9MUZU8hLEdw,1,"Was supposed to be taking a 230 connecting flight to Philly. Pushed back to 3pm with no apparent explanation. As I'm sitting waiting for my flight, the next gate over (Nevada to North Carolina)  the attendants ask for 18 volunteers to take a next flight due to capacity & plane weight issues. I think what she meant to say is that they overbooked the flight by 18 people. I wouldn't advise anyone to book with US Airways at this point in time.

Got on the plane from Nevada to Philly which was indeed a half an hour late. We landed in Philly to catch the connecting flight. Plane was late & took a additional 15 mins to open the door to the plane so passengers can exit. Needless to say I missed my connecting flight to NY. The airline staff provided vouchers for a hotel & a next day flight upon plane exit. Tried to see if I could get my checked bags so I could possibly go to NY on my own being that it's only 2hrs away and I didn't want to stay in Philly. Was informed by staff that they didn't have enough man power or staff to release passengers bags. So the only way to retrieve bags would be to take the flight in the morning or drive and go to the LGA to pick 'em in the morning. Not Cool. Ended up staying the night in Philly.

Not the worst airline experience I've heard of, bur definitely my  worst airline experience."
2010-12-31,US Airways,KKVDeSxSZZ55zXkFc6-40g,1,"Horrible horrible airline. The plane on my return flight could not even fit my carry-on in the overhead luggage compartment. The airline failed to inform me of this before hand. During the flight, the flight attendant managed to skip my row when serving refreshments. I only recommend this airline for quick, cheap, last minute flights."
2011-03-11,US Airways,-BEgQY85Ncra35BPsYsYHg,1,"This airline is horrible. I made a trip to Mexico and was charged 25 usd for 1 bag. The airline staff told me that only ""international flights"" were not charged this fee and that mine  WASN'T international because you have to travel ""through oceans"". WTF

I asked them if I woud had to pay the fee if travelled to Patagonia, Argentina. I got the same lame response. For US Airways every flight is ""domestic"" within the hemisphere."
2011-04-19,US Airways,GnPEzYiCymGNu2PZV_zQbg,1,"I flew with us airways about three times in the last few months b/c they were the cheapest at the time. I have to say that my first experience with them was the worst but i caved in on the prices. I've flown american, delta, sw, alaska, jetblue, virgin, ...and more that i cannot remember. Yes i get to my destinations alive, but hours later and feeling awful. Every single flight, including the connecting ones have been delayed without fail. Sometimes they are rude to sometimes, sometimes they ignore you, and sometimes they just keep lying to you about when you're taking off. Don't expect an apology whether you are super sweet or boisterously angry. And if you need their help, yiu might have to ask a couple ppl at the counter before one of them does anything for you. I finally swore them off and I am so happy to fly with other airlines again. Sometimes aa or other airlines come much cheaper, so look really hard to steer clear of US.

Oh one more thing, the space(seats and aisles) is smaller than all the others as well (except maybe spirit).
Whew! And done. GL flying!"

2011-06-22,US Airways,bOWem5vr2hRJNGEUHC6Oqw,2,"For the long flight to and from Philly, I've taken US Airways twice now.  Neither time was I impressed.

Was it the cheapest option: yes.  And that's how 90% of us purchase tickets, so I doubt the things we complain about will really improve.

Somehow on US Air, the seats feel even narrower than the competition despite the fact they fly the same 737s and A319s in the same configuration. But, I had no problem with finding overhead space, which is rare nowadays, so that earns them a bump.

No seatback TVs is a downer on a cross-country flights, no TVs of any kind was a bit surprising (though a relief: if I can't control it, I hate having something running in the background).

They ran out of food before reaching all the way in the back (though prices were better than the airport to be fair).  But the attendants were helpful, professional, and did a second round of drinks.

Will I fly them again?  Probably, but if there's a flight on United or better for an extra $30 I'd probably take that."
2011-06-23,US Airways,Zhr6-Q1p0gYXs-FemeSFIQ,1,"This was my first time flying US Airways ever....and trust me, that was my last time. Let me tell you why...

After a night of partying and getting up extra early to return our rental car and get through security on time, we finally arrive at the airport around 10am. We're relaxing...drinking Starbucks and buying souvenirs until I realized on the Departures List that our flight is delayed by 20 minutes. Not too bad right?? I grab my friend and advise her that we need to get through security just in case!

We float through security and we reach the assigned gate...and we stop in our tracks! Theres already 50 people in line at the gate! A passenger walks by and says that they're sending people to another gate so I follow him while my friend waits in line. As soon as we get to the gate on the other side of the terminal, a US Airways rep in a thick Spanish accent yells ""I can't help you guys. I don't even know why they are sending everyone to my gate. I have to worry about my own flight!!"" We all stare at her with our Deer in Headlights look...seriously?? Was she just yelling at us? Shouldnt we be the ones upset?

I walk away from that gate and I try the next gate to at least get some information about our flight. Another US Airways rep was able to tell me that our plane was stuck in Phoenix due to mechanical problems. Ok well...I walk back to our gate, I inform the passengers around me, and I stick a dollar into a nearby slot machine. And I win $5! Yayyy! Let me tell you...thats the only good thing that happens to me on this day.

We waited in line for another 30 minutes and the guy behind me suggests that I contact US Airways on my cellphone while in line. I call and Gia was very helpful. She was able to find my friend and I another flight before we even reached the desk at our gate. After another 1 and 1/2 of waiting, the only thing I needed to do was get my new boarding passes and my $5 meal voucher. Yes, you read it right folks! $5 meal voucher!  I feel like a valuable customer now:).

Then, I had about 15 minutes to grab the blandest sandwich in the world that set me back $10...OOOooo I'm sorry with my meal voucher it was $5. :) And then I had to run to catch my flight! 

And remember that US Airways rep with the thick Spanish accent, yeah....that *****, I gave her the biggest smile as she checked my NEW boarding pass and gate checked my bag for FREE!! 

Needless to say, 1st and last experience with US Airways!"

The two flights--one from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and the other from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre--Scranton were both on time.

Service was pleasant.  We flew first class on the LAS to PHL leg and that certainly makes a big difference.  Lunch was actually quite good and the chocolate cake dessert was rich and tasty.

OK, US Airways, keep the rating going with my return flight--I dare you!"

Flight to Vegas was on time but the flight going back to PHL was delayed by about a half hour. Did not affect me much but others with connecting flights were pulling their hair out. Both flights were overbooked (hate when they do that).

By the time we got to board both flights of our trip the overhead compartments were FULL so we had to check our carryon luggage. Thankfully there was no charge. Our actual checked bags on the other hand were 25 bucks a bag because we booked last January. I think it's even more now. At least in Vegas they asked ahead of time if we wanted to check our carryons for free well in advance of boarding. In PHL we were almost on the plane when they yanked our carryons away from us. 

I like non-stop flights and US Airways seems to have them at the best times to fly. Would have liked to upgrade to first class but they have such a limited number on their Airbus planes. Like 4 rows? 16 seats? come on.

Ended up buying a fruit and cheese platter on the flight. Fresh yes but not even close to being worth 8 bucks."
2011-12-15,US Airways,q2LRD5i0Iy2yQM25mQ942Q,4,"Airline travel is a crapshoot.  I've flown every US based airline and they all pretty much have the same issues.  US Airways out of PHL is fantastic as far as schedules and the airport is pretty nice.  Customer service in the airport and on the aircrafts are also like playing lotto.  But then again, this goes for everyone else in the business.  There's a certain airline that loads their passengers like cattle and you couldn't pay me to fly them, yet while everyone applauds them, I've been treated very shabbily every time I've had to use their services.

I'll stick to US Airways and their convenient flights and prices."

I did find them to be a bit more bare bones than I'm accustomed to. No TVs and no meals (unless purchased through the flight attendants, although they really encourage you to bring your own food). They also charge for checked baggage. I know most domestic flights do nowadays, but it's becoming more and more annoying.

The loading process was not very efficient. This part always seemed to take a lot longer than I'm used to, even when boarding large international flight I have never seen the boarding process this slow. Definitely not one of my favorite airlines I have traveled with thus far."

Once again I procrastinated too long and had to settle with a last min Hotwire deal from Las Vegas to Charlotte, NC, and again from Charlotte, NC to Baltimore, MD. 

The check-in here in Vegas was pretty easy. All I had to do was go to a little kiosk and enter my confirmation number. Once I did this, I attempted to change our seating arrangement. We booked our flights together and still got seated 6 rows apart. So I changed them and noticed it was going to be a fee of $68 dollars each. Heck, it was only $75 to upgrade to 1st class. I can't make sense of this. 

We kept our seats and headed to the gate. 

After boarding the plane and being seated I became more comfortable, probably because I was so tired and the seats gave me decent leg room. I stand near 6'1"" so this worked out fine. 

I didn't stay awake much so I can't comment on what was offered food and drink wise. However I did see the flight crew carrying cans of soda and iced tea before dozing off.. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fast forward to my flight from Charlotte, NC to Baltimore, MD. We boarded on time after our lay over and I felt more awake after my morning meal. 

Once inside the plane I noticed the seats were not the same, bummer. My next concern was leg room. It was about the same just less cushion in the seat. At this point I was thankful enough I only had 1 more hour in the air until my destination. 

This time around I made it to the drinks. I ordered a water and that was just what i needed to nap the rest of the way.

I arrived at the airport in enough time, and even rightly so if they couldn't check my bags they should have made a way for me to take my bags with me. I never received the customer service i received from them before with any other airline in all my travels. I was outraged and they only thing the customer service rep did was change me to a later flight which didn't help me because that was leaving 8 hrs later than my original flight. I will no longer go through U.S. Airways ever again and probably won't book a trip through your website based on my experience. I ended up having to pay for another flight on a different airline and when i told U.S airways that she then proceeded to tell me i was unable to even get back all my money i spent on that ticket to use towards another flight in the future, which just made matters worst. I was very upset at that point and felt like i was taken advantage of.

My company booked this airline for my trip and I didn't have much of a choice.  Thankfully it was a very short trip. (las vegas to phoenix to yuma arizona)  The airlines is VERY barebones, worse then a low cost airline. They have no monitors on their planes, no entertainment or anything, their gates are always at the very end of the concourse.  When heading home from phx to las  the speaker was too soft in the gate area and people were all gathering around trying to board and the agent was having a hard time controlling the crowd because no one knew what zone they were boarding because we couldn't hear anything.  

I have never had a desire to fly usair and I still don't.

Two experiences on USAIR were pretty egregious, so I should have known that anything is possible, but they had the only convenient flight from KCI to Las Vegas and Phoenix is not a bad place to change planes during the winter. Flying out of the run down looking Terminal 1 in Las Vegas -- and USAIR's are always the farthest from the security lanes --  was a bad start to an otherwise unenjoyable trip on USAIR.  Once on board it was no better, with no video monitors and no beverage service.
There are alternatives still, and in the future I'll definite consider those instead.  Most recently I discovered that being Silver on United Airlines, entitles me to no perks or preferences when flying on USAIR other than the allowed one checked bag (which I rarely if never use). If I were Silver on USAIR or had a MasterCard or was traveling with a 2 year old yes, but being a frequent flyer on another Star Alliance Member airline wasn't worth very much.  I do like the upgrades available -- for a price -- and First Class travel on USAIR can be pretty luxe.  But as long as I'm a loyal United flyer I'll stick with United when I can."

US Airways Flight 4427
Philadelphia to Baltimore
August 8th, 2013
Flight Cancelled

I was not late to my flight, I did not miss the date, I did everything correct. It was -your- airline that created the entire problem by overbooking all flights that came after our cancelled flight that day. The only resolution offered to us that would fly us directly to Baltimore would have been to take a flight leaving -11 HOURS- (9pm) after our originally scheduled flight (11am). That is not acceptable.

This was the answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt:

""When a customer accepts accommodations to an alternate airport, the customer assumes responsibility for the additional expenses.""

To note here, we did not ""assume"" the extra expenses. We were given no other choice if we wanted to reach Baltimore in time. We accepted a flight to DC because it was our only alternative that would get us close enough to take public transportation to Baltimore, and to meet our deadline.

I did ask if we could be provided a rental car so we could drive ourselves from Philadelphia, and that request was immediately denied. As it was, we had to spend our own money for all public transportation from DC to Baltimore so we could meet our group waiting for us in time. This is also not acceptable. It took us FOUR trains to get from DC to Baltimore in unfamiliar territory. Why should this cost be on us?

This was a second answer I received from US Airways customer service employee Edie Curt:

""There are no federal aviation regulations concerning what an airline must do to compensate passengers when the carrier delays or cancels a flight. This is true regardless of the reason for the delay/cancellation (e.g., weather, mechanical, crew availability, etc.).""

So basically because it is not ILLEGAL, they are not required to help their customers in any way. Beware if you are flying US Airways in the future, I would consider otherwise. I have flown on other airlines and I have always either been provided a hotel, food, direct compensation for a future flight or alternate transportation to my exact destination at no cost to myself.

Keeping the money we paid for services you did not deliver upon is considered theft. Your airline is a poor excuse for a business, and we will never fly with you again.

Sincerely,

Anne K."

Jus so you all know, do not fly with US Airways! You will regret it tremendously!"

Any seat you might not want next to the bathroom, curb side check in - 2 more dollars please, 31 dollars for speedy check in, first class upgrade.... they are the typical creepy horrible airline when it comes to talking to them. These guys suck. If someone did what southwest was doing but with assigned seats... they'd take this thing down."
2014-06-17,US Airways,2T8AVoSuh31NChLDZx98eg,3,"This is a nice little airport with some food outlets & a duty free service that will send your purchases straight to the gate for you so that you don't have to lug them around with your hand luggage while you pass the time in the airport.

They also have some fantastically funny staff who were able to calm and cheer up the crowd when our flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to an unruly passanger on the previous plane. Overall a good experience!"
2014-07-01,US Airways,Zm_Z6ZMqSoXzP7YwECYm7A,1,"I have never had such CONSISTENTLY poor customer service from any company I have ever done business with!
Are these employees not trained in HOW to give good customer service, or have they been trained, but just don't give a darn about their customers/passengers?
Either way, the result is the same... horrendous customer service! 
Most recently: on my flight the day b4 yesterday, the ticket agent weighed my bag & told me it was ""over"", then calmly stated, ""That will be $100."" I asked how MUCH ""over"" it was & she refused to answer me. I said, ""I don't HAVE $100!"", & she rolled her eyes & shrugged. Then, the sky cap who had accompanied me from the curb looked @ the scale &
said, ""Just take a few things out- its not much."" From the suitcase, I took out a plastic bag with 3 pr of sandals- maybe 2 lbs. & put in my carry-on. The sky cap then told me the weight was fine! Then the bag was labeled & taken by the agent with a scowl! I gave the helpful skycap a second healthy tip 4 saving me $100!
This time, I was traveling because of a family emergency & had just bought the ticket less than 12 hrs before. I explained this 2her.  However, THEN, this same counter agent refused 2 let me transport my O2 Concentrator without a doctor's letter. I said ""Its only being transported, NOT USED, & I did this with NO problem, just months ago, after reading your [US Airways] website re baggage policies.""
Agent says, ""You should have read it again. The policy changed the end of April! You can't take it without a doctor's letter.""  
Long story, but IT WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE...  !!!!!!
There've been several other instances over the past 2-3 yes, but this time, I traveled alone & clearly have medical issues. I was EXTREMELY frustrated & the agents I've dealt with were without patience (although no one else in line behind me) & without compassion, or even manners. Just plain RUDE! 
I have never been treated this poorly on any other airline (or business). You can b certain that I will NEVER fly US AIR, ever again, regardless of price. Not worth the hassle!!!
I hope their recent merger with AAL heralds an improvement. Time will tell..."
2014-07-08,US Airways,MyW-KV_xSt1JimdJamRgUQ,1,"On 6-24-14 I used US Airways as my carrier on a round trip from Honolulu to Denver.  After many years of using Hawaiian Air, United Air, and Delta Air I decided to fly US Airways.  One of the biggest mistakes I have done in my life.  On 6-24-14 I arrived at HNL airport before the recommended 2 hour time prior to take off.  Upon my arrival I noticed that the plane was already at the gate.  They loaded the first group of passengers and then the gate personnel said that there was a problem with the air conditioning so everyone had to deplane.  This plane was at the gate for over two hours and no one noticed that the AC was out?  We finally take off an hour and a half late.  We arrived at Phoenix and I had to run to my next connection gate.  I barely made my connection flight to Denver, but my carry-on which I was told to check at the gate because there was no room on the plane did not make it.  Upon my arrival at Denver the baggage service agent said that since the bag won't arrive until after three I wouldn't get my bag until after 6:30 pm.  I didn't want to take the chance so I decided to drive an hour and a half back and forth from Colorado Springs and Denver to be sure I got my bag.  

My return trip back to Honolulu was even worse.  Again I got to the airport two hours prior to boarding.  A plane was at the gate but the gate agent told me that it wasn't my flight.  The gate agent assured me that this would be the gate for boarding.  Half hour prior to boarding the gate agent tells everyone that we need to switch gates then we had to wait another half hour for another plane to taxi out of the gate.  When my flight finally arrived at the gate it was discovered that one of the rear emergency masks was faulty.  Again we have to wait.  We are finally allowed to board on the plane a half hour after the scheduled boarding time to wait another two hours to take off.  First the pilot says they have to refuel then we couldn't take off because of weather.  This caused me to miss my conncection flight to Honolulu from Phoenix.  While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay.  Thank God my wife was able to convince an agent to put me on an American Air flight that would get me back to Hawaii on that day.  Here's the kicker after a stressful trip I write US Airways of my complaint.  You would figure they would give something but you know what I get.  I get a ""we are sorry"" letter and that's it.  At least United Air was willing to give me a $100.00 certificate for my next travel when my flight was cancelled.  I will never fly US Airways again.  I suggest you all to pay the extra money and fly with someone else.  These guys suck."
2010-08-12,Spirit Airlines,mE-bTR8x0Z1pvulZNbNw8w,1,"I flew on this airline from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  The flight there was horrible....I am 5'9 and my legs did not fit behind the seat in front of me.  On the way back I thought I lucked out  by getting an aisle seat.... only to be delayed at the airport due to the airline holding the plane (while waiting for one of their own connecting flights) for almost TWO hours.  This made the fact that I bought a pricey nonstop flight worthless to me when I ended up sore with black and blue marks on my knees from the flight there, and sick after a 7 hour return trip that should have only taken 4 1/2 hours.  I would NEVER recommend this airline.  (Not to mention any carry on bigger than a back pack, you have to pay to check, even as a carry on, for more than the price it is to check a bag!)"

The reason for actually writing a review, I wish I could give zero stars.  My brother flew out last night...Las Vegas to Detroit.  He waited to check his bag for 2 hours, because they were letting another flight skip in front of him.  He is handicapped, only has one leg.  He never uses his handicap, after waiting in line for that long he asked for some assistance or a handicap line.  The Spirit agent told him there was no handicap line and that he should use the leg he had to get through the line.  I will never fly Spirit again and I will tell everyone I can about this.  Spirit Airlines, making comments about someones handicap is going too far."
2011-06-10,Spirit Airlines,tYdGITjMG840fVJXEzEWAw,1,I would not give this airline any stars. I was flying my kids unaccompanied back from dfw. The people on the phone could not give me direct answers so I said screw it I will go to.the airport and book the flight. They were just as vague with their answers. I went american airlines instead and will never use spirit again. They may be cheaper in theory but faster they tack on all their fees they are actually more than the other airlines. Beware!!!
2011-07-05,Spirit Airlines,If-w-i8NQ0zLFkF5Id3nWw,1,"First and last time flying with this airline. I went from L.A. to Vegas and back, I had pre-paid for a checked bag both ways (which they told me I should pay/add after I booked the flight and gave them my credit card info). When I got to check in counter I saw the carry on fee was more than the checked bag fee, so I asked to be sure I was good (I had a carry on and a personal bag) I was told it was fine and boarded the plane no problems. The plane was filthy, trash every where, just gross. The seats seem really cramped (more so than other airlines). 

On the way back from Vegas to L.A. I was told I would have to pay to bring my carry on, when I asked why, I was told that is their policy and I should have been charged on the way there. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the guy said he was the only one available and I was not going to be able to take my bag. All he could do was put me on the next day's plane. When I finally just told him I'd put the contents of my carry on into my other bag and he could keep the bag he said he could check it for me but I couldn't bring it on. There's no reason I shouldn't be able to bring it on, had I brought 5 shopping bags on that would have been fine (as many other people did this and of course stored them in the overhead bins). 

Once again the plane was cramped and filthy. I will never fly this airline again."
2011-07-05,Spirit Airlines,KkVjYVsURkILfWHny8sKhQ,3,"My flight LAX to Vegas was not so great, an hour delay and did you know that Spirit's baggage weight allowed is lower than other airlines (already $30 a bag or $40 at the airport if under weight)? Yes, the ticket was only $170 round trip but you don't get service with it. You also don't get an assigned seat unless you want to pay for it.

Spirit earns its 3 stars because on my way back to LA I was running extremely late and would not have made my flight if it weren't for a great employee that jumped me to the head of the checkin line. I was pretty grateful.

The airplane was gross. The seats were a hard plastic and dirty. Luckily half of the plane was empty so I got to sit in the row by myself. What concerned me the most however was the noise of the plane before it took off and after it landed. It was this clicking/breaking/ scratching noise and it sounded like the plane was going to break down. I was concerned about this when we took off and am glad to have landed safely. I would not fly this airline again."
2011-07-18,Spirit Airlines,gGn_SH9atrjXnpYZHUjCzw,1,I will not fly on this airlines again. Terrible service provided by employees who are clearly not caring about delivering good service. Then to get on a plane that was filthy....peanuts in a bag found in the pocket. And the dirtiest seats.   And then they charge you for everything a la carte taken way too far... I will pay extra for better employees and cleanliness
2011-08-01,Spirit Airlines,cX78gF00Zbtkx669ejhfmA,1,"Like others said, if I could give negative stars, I would.  Only booked them because it was the cheapest fare...purposely packed everything in a small suitcase so I didn't have to check anything - only to find out they considered my carry-on too big.  $38 to check it.  Which it turns out is actually better than the $40 to carry it on!!  Ridiculous!  Never again."
2011-08-10,Spirit Airlines,egy6mwS5FdLastPsYIe9WQ,1,"Decided to check out this airline because of the cheaper at advertised prices.  What we felled to see is the crazy charges for everything else.  Any bag over 40lbs-upcharge, Cary on bag above a small in size - upcharge, and any sort of drink - upcharge.  The staff was all very friendly and as far as cost goes it was about the same as the big competitors.  Really no savings.  Both of the planes we flew (round trip) were extremely cramped, and the seats did not recline.  I usually don't recline out of kindness for the people behind me, but these seats were almost completely upright."
2011-08-18,Spirit Airlines,48V-xzmuUkElNX578zo4Rw,1,"WOW! Is all I have to say. I have not even got onto my flight yet and I am extremely angry as I write this. 

I booked a flight from LAS VEGAS to LA to visit my girlfriend. The flight was only $100 round trip. 

I went on-line to confirm my flight and check in... I had to pay $10 dollars for a seat both ways- so an additional $20 then to even check my bag as a CARRY ON I had to pay $33 each way so an additional $66 

My $100 flight turned into almost a $200 flight. It would be nice if companies such as CHEAPOAIR or PRICELINE would advise you that when you book with this company that there will be extra fees. 

Also my bags were supposed to be $28 a bag but the on-line system charged me $33. I called SPIRIT (which had the most difficult time finding a customer service phone number) to ask them why I am paying more money than what is stated. The lady advised me that if I confirmed my flight 24 hours or less prior to my flight starting, that I had to pay an additional fee for my bag. 

HOW IS THIS COMPANY STILL IN BUSINESS....? 

I should have paid $150 with SOUTHWEST who I know I can trust. I have been reading all these reviews - and I am so scared to even get onto my flight..... I am not good with rude customer service.. especially when I am already very upset. 

Luckily it is only a 1 hour flight- so I should be okay..... 

If only I would of yelped them prior to booking.... all I saw was CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP rates flashing across the screen... and overlooked and didn't use my YELP. YELP will never fail you, because there are real people with real reviews that you can trust. Next time I will never book anything without reading about it first :("
2011-08-18,Spirit Airlines,FPT8CsQQ30lqw9shZRCASw,1,"Worst airline ever. I've always flown with either Delta or American Airlines and have never had a problem from point of purchase to the point of return, so I was expecting the same thing when I purchased my tickets on line for Spirit.

I had to catch an 8am flight so I arrived at the airport at 7am. The first thing I noticed was that they had no designated kiosks to print off your boarding pass. I remembered from prior visits to that airport that they had general kiosks scattered around the place. I typed my information in and after it showed me all my flight details, when it came time to print,  received the message ""error, please see an agent for assistance. I tried again at that kiosk but got the same response as my result.

I then had to wait in literally the longest line I could see to talk to a Spirit representative. I didn't make it to the front desk until 7:46..keep in mind I got there at 7am and my flight was at 8am. The lady told me I was too late, but she called upstairs and turns out they didn't even start boarding yet. That was cool for me in this case but overall, that's pretty unprofessional of the airline. I did end up making this flight because they didn't even start boarding until 8:30.

I found out why they don't have kiosks though. They make you talk to the representative so they can charge you an extra $40 for your CARRY-ON! No other airline has ever made me pay for my carry-on. I was shocked when she hit me up for it. I ended up spending an extra $80 since I was going round trip on this airline. The only reason I took Spirit airline was because the tickets were cheap. Had I known that they were going to tag close to another $100 in hidden fees on, I would have just bought the more expensive ticket from a trusted airline. 

I will say that the flight itself was the most turbulent-less flight I've ever been on, but all the other chaos you have to deal with before even getting on the plane doesn't make up for the smooth ride."

They charge you where you sit, they charge you for a carry-on bag, and they charge you for a beverage.  The carry-on charge is more than the check-in luggage, which is ridiculous.  They charge you for a glass of water which is also ridiculous.  The economy seating is awful, my knees were rubbing up against the back of the seat in front of me.  Each time the concession cart came by it hit me in the elbow, while i was trying to sleep in those God awful seats.  I learned my lesson, next time I will go with any airline, at the end of the day, the other airline will probably be cheaper..."

So i called the customer service department to ask to be refunded and they were like ummm no! The customer service rep was horrible not because he didnt refund me but because he talked to be like I was stupid and like what I was saying made absolutely no sense. So I asked to speak to his manager who told me that I should like the club cuz i get $10 off checked bags...WTF!

When I checked in at DFW Airport, I was informed at the check in desk that it would be $40 to take my carry on bag aboard the plane & stow it away.

But on our return trip, Gena at the Spirit Airline Check In didn't charge us any money for our same carry on.  
So BIG PROPS to Gena, but still say Spirit SUCKS as a company for their devious policies!!!"
2011-09-19,Spirit Airlines,7iXqAlPrgAZIaU5hQcFqAQ,1,"Don't be fooled by their $9.00 cheap airline club like me ! I thought how cool this would be so I can visit my friends and family back in San Diego more often . I joined the club then when I start booking my flight there were are all of these hidden fees. 

There is a $40.00 each way baggage fee. If your luggage goes over 40 pounds they will charge you another $40.00. Since they didn't want to give me a refund on my membership fee I decided next time I will not bring any luggage. I just stored some clothes in San Diego so I wouldn't have to pay this ridiculous fee. You can bring a small carry on like a back pack or a purse. 

You have to pay for your seat. Just because you bought the ticket doesn't mean you have a seat. This fee applies both ways. I think I paid $10.00 each way. 

There is also a reservation fee. I forgot how much that was. 

Don't come on the plane hungry or thirsty because you have to pay for everything! We bought two canned drinks for $5.00 or you would pay $3.50 for one. I didn't even have a chance to drink all my cranberry juice because as soon as I started drinking we were getting ready to land so we had to throw away our trash. If you are going on a short trip don't bother getting any drinks just wait until you land. 

This airline doesn't allow you to be even four minutes late so be on time or you will have to purchase a new ticket like my cousin. They stick to a strict schedule . 

Even though the boarding pass said when they would be loading I checked with one of their customer service agents too. She talked to us like we were slow. My husband said he felt dumb asking such a question. I told him I would feel even more dumb if they changed the schedule and we missed our flight! I wouldn't want to pay for another two tickets!"
2011-09-20,Spirit Airlines,3W5bc-ha9rAWGHtpZA6vAA,1,"Worst. Airline. EVER.

I never flew Spirit before but when I was looking for a last second ticket to LA, $63 for a round trip ticket sounded like a dream come true. It was TOO good. 

My flight to LA from Vegas was delayed almost THREE HOURS due to a mechanical problem. This is after I had already been at the airport for over an hour for my original layover time. 

The plane itself was filthy. You can definitely tell it's an old plane. And there was so much dirt and grim between the hinges on the seats it would make anyone squirm. 

The staff couldn't care less that you're there. It's like you're annoying them because you're there. Even though it's their job to serve you!

Also, beware! This airline charges for everything from snacks to carry on. Luckily, I took a look at their baggage fee list before I packed for my trip. The only free bag you get is a personal item that will fit under the seat in front of you. 

But the worst thing of it all was the flight into Vegas on the way home. The pilot announced that we were descending. Everything was going okay until suddenly it felt like THE PLANE JUST DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY. It was only a few seconds, but my heart felt like it just dropped to the floor. I thought the plane was crashing. I think the pilot was trying to be humorous and said ""Is everyone awake now?"".

Don't ever use this airline! It's worth the extra $50 for the next airline up."

So I picked the cheapest $10, when I arrived at the airport I then learned that it was $40 to check my bag, I questioned the agent and she told me that it is cheaper to check the bag online, why didn't they say this on the website? So now I'm infuriated. I get on the plane and notice how dirty the headrests on the seats were, they were black. Then one of the stewardess' came over the speaker and announced ""if you have a device that has an on/off button, it needs to be turned off, it's not that hard people"" I'm sorry, what? Is that how you speak to the customers? The seats were so uncomfortable and then we took off and there was a loud unsettling noise I thought the wings were going to fall off.

My husband who is 6',2'' had to sit sideways because his knees were jammed into the seats in front of us.   There is no complimentary anything, not even water!  

Secondly, our flight was cancelled on our return.  The only options we were given were 1.) a refund or 2.) a flight the next day at 9 pm, hotel stay at Motel 6 and food vouchers to Dennys!  I think not-- we took the refund and arranged alternative transportation.

Will I fly Spirit again? Maybe, but once you factor in all of the extra charges, the dirty planes, the lack of legroom, the broken seats, the B squad flight attendants, and the general stupidity of a policy that makes it more expensive to carry on your own bag than to check it, probably not."

   After a fabulous weekend in Vegas I looked forward to my 1hr. flight back to SanDiego""ahhhh i'd avoid being in a car for 5 hours & avoid traffic this is gonna be GREAT!"" Wrong again!
  Now as a frequent traveler i totally understand sometimes things happen with planes, sometimes there's delays etc. What i can not understand is the way all of the passengers on flight 619 were treated by the spirit agents at Macarran airport in Vegas. 
  Flights all day were backed up by 3 to 4 hours because a whole crew didnt show up. so why was i not told this when i arrived for check in at 7pm?Instead they inform noone that our flight wont be leaving until 12:25 am. Now if you do the math thats 5 1/2 hours of waiting for a 1 hour flight i couldve gotten home faster driving or couldve stayed longer at my hotel had i known.
  None of the spirit employees or agents were anywhere to be found. Certainly not at the front to answer question. However an agent did come to the front a little after 9:30 pm and was so kind enough to offer all of us a $7.00 meal voucher. Now thats class spirit!!! Great way to keep people happy :).
  At that time a supervisor was requested to come & answer some of our questions did anyone ever show? Of course not. You know it really wasnt what was happening but how the employees handeled it noone seemed to care i mean how can a whole flight be booked but no crew around to get us there?
   Finally 12:30 am a plane arrives now i need to mention once boarded the flight attendants that were already on board & pilot were beyond kind, understanding, and pleasant to be around Its a shame we didnt get that at the actual airport. We landed into sandiego at 1:52 am. 
  By the time i got my car and drove home from airport i was in bed by 3:30 am thanks Spirit for ruining my monday & thanks for leaving that bitter taste in my mouth.

2011-10-21,Spirit Airlines,O_JmRlqfS-wbJEolTKM3BA,1,"First of all the plane didn't even arrive at the time it was supposed to to pick us up, which was probably caused by the second issue I will address.  The airport gate did not have a single representative to tell us what was actually happening so at the time we were supposed to board the plane NOBODY had a clue what was going on.  There were no gate agents from Spirit ... the gate agents from a neighboring airline actually got on the PA and made an announcement that they did not know where the airplane was and that they were not employees of Spirit Airlines.

The plane had trouble with the starter which delayed us ....and it probably delayed every prior flight as well... but the worst part was the horrible sound that happened as we were taxi-ing out.  There's no way to describe it other than a DJ ""scratching"" .... apparently this wasn't the only flight for that to happen in .... another passenger also told me this happened in another flight ...

-WATER and peanuts on the plane. RIDICULOUS.
-To choose your seat. RIDICULOUS. 

// FACILITIES //

The plane was disgusting and filthy with tiny seats. I'm 5'1"" and petite, and I already felt so cramped. 

// SERVICE // Sarcastic and mouthy flight attendants 

Save yourself the headache and do not fly Spirit Airlines. EVER."
2011-11-14,Spirit Airlines,TT7MaaiCbH2q8TVRCZMB9g,1,"I thought Southwest was bordering on ghetto, but Spirit makes it look like British Airways.  It was .... barely serviceable for the price.  It was a short trip to Vegas, but it smelled a little like the public parking lots in Santa Monica - namely, urine.  The seats reminded me of folding chairs with a worn-out cushion.  There's a charge, it was $25 as I recall, for any carry-on bag other than a personal item, not to mention the charge for checked items."
2011-11-14,Spirit Airlines,HTZUoOY48Izk6uyoIV85-g,1,"I flew Spirit from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas and primarily chose them because of their fare. First off let me say I am not someone who is unfamiliar with the airline industry. I spent 20 years working in the travel industry and nearly half of that working for one of the largest airlines in the world. 

I cannot speak for their other station operations but I will tell you that their Fort Lauderdale operation is one of the most backwards (insert expletive here) operations I have ever seen. You walk in and they have a huge blue sign for self check in which states ""carry on bags only"". Another line with a large red sign stated ""full service check in"". After spending a half an hour in that line we were told we needed to be in the self service line because this line was for ""international only"". I explained that I could plainly see the signs above the agents said international but all of the others said ""self check in"". Didn't matter, we were rerouted to stand in the self check in line, in spite of the fact that we had checked bags. Because apparently I was supposed to psychically know that even though the sign said ""carry on only"" they would also check our bags. After making our way through what could loosely be referred to as a mob my husband and I finally checked in and paid our $166.00 for baggage (insert several other expletives here) only to to be sent to another line to hand off our bags. Well the other line turned out to be another check in line. I am not unaccustomed to lines, even confusing ones that evolve due to large groups of people but these were not lines. They were swirling confused masses of people with little or no direction.

I didn't find my plane in particular to be unclean or the flight staff to be rude but after looking over the charges for everything (water, soda...) I began to wonder if the sick bag I had taken and used for my used kleenex (sue me I have a cold) wouldn't end up being an extra charge as well."
2011-11-15,Spirit Airlines,4RjqjwBHJ3gY8HZj7UBfDQ,2,"I had the displeasure of sitting in the last row of the plane on a departure flight. After an exhausting weekend in Vegas, the last thing you want to hear is an insecure flight attendant narrating her pathetic dating history to a fellow employee. The check-in desk attendant was a little rough with my bag (essentially throwing my luggage on the conveyer belt). At least there were no delays.

To my credit, it wasn't my choice to fly Spirit, but knowing I was, I didn't have high flight prospects. Ridiculous baggage fees, no complimentary snacks/drinks, and no leg room--does anyone really expect more from this airline?"
2011-11-17,Spirit Airlines,jAGAYpmJUp7l_3MIP6QUsQ,1,Yelp needs a no star. Because this is what  these people deserve. Headed back to Chicago and what a surprise! My flight is delayed. Just like it was on the way to Vegas. Lady at the counter here was VERY rude and she started complaining to her co-worker about taking her Pen. Talk about being professional in front of customers. Spirit is definitely an airline I will not ever fly. Sorry Southwest. I will be back soon.
2011-11-21,Spirit Airlines,U_kZM4n05J4ZXOuO8Je5Xw,2,"Flew Spirit from San Diego to Las Vegas.  And I might do it again.

They are pretty cheap, but they charge for everything.  Carry-on is $30 pre-paid or $45 the day of.  Checked bags were $50 prepaid and more the day of.  Choosing your seat is $10.  All the food was for sale (they have alcohol deals, like buy 2 save $3 or buy 3 save $5).  So if you don't have bags, they're really cheap and may be a good option for you.

The seats in the back are cramped.  I'm 5'7"" and I fit just fine (with room), but anyone taller than 5'11"" is going to be cramped in the back coach seats.  The seats are also OLD.  This was an OLD 737.  But the flight was only 50 min in the air.  They did take off about 15 minutes late and arrive about 15 min late.

I would probably use them again, but if I were taller, I wouldn't.  I also would NEVER fly further than SD to LV.  I can justify an hour, but not further than that."
2011-11-26,Spirit Airlines,lJ_KP4VksAs189sImJhL5A,3,"The flight from Portland Oregon was cheap but you pay for what you get...small seats, no room to move and charges for everything...the flights itself was fine for the most part but coming back to Oregon the pilot gave everyone the scores for the u of o game which upset people then tried to recover by giving out free airlines miles when signing up for a spirit credit card."
2011-11-27,Spirit Airlines,6TPc_nSGo2NhVM1zYqkcjw,3,"I flew from Portland to Vegas for $135 during Thanksgiving break.  Now that's cheap!  

Throughout both of my flights I was mentally writing my yelp review and envisioned a 1 or 2 star review.  Today, though, as I sat down to write it though, I couldn't do it.

Yes, the planes are old.  My fellow travelers ridiculed the planes, the seats, the interiors on both flights.  

Yes, there are lots of fees.  But it is possible to travel without paying any of them, especially if you are traveling by yourself or if you are going only on a short trip.  The $135 I paid was the total and included tax.  I paid no fees.    I didn't reserve a seat (and despite this I still had an aisle seat both ways).  I didn't pay a bag fee and instead brought only a small backback which fit underneath the seat.  Yes, you have to pay for food or drink but this is true of many airlines.  If you have a problem with it, buy something in the airport.

Yes, the seats are small.  I'm not sure how but it definitely seems as if there are more seats than usual crammed onto the plane.  However, I'm 5  feet tall and small and so all was fine for me.  Those of you who are tall I'm sure have issues on most planes.

It's true.  I would prefer to fly on a 'fancier, newer plane.'  However, for short-haul trips and for the price, Spirit is a good deal.  The flights took off and arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled time.  The staff were professional.  Really, I have no complaints and would recommend flying Spirit."
2011-11-29,Spirit Airlines,hS9tUpiRMMq3Nr15diQoaw,1,I was traveling from Las Vegas to Oakland CA and had a flight scheduled for 9:45pm.  The representative at the gate let us know that was plane was being delayed about a half an hour.  We were updated every 30 minutes to an hour with the same update.  The n it became that they were doing maintenance on the plane.  We were held hostage for 4 hours then they canceled the flight.  There customer service was extremely poor and they may have cheap flights but it's not worth it if you need to get anywhere you need to go.  I had to book a flight the next morning with Southwest.   I can certainly say that I will never use Spirit Airlines again and I hope they go bankrupt!!!!
2011-12-01,Spirit Airlines,m8b7uUNKzgdTlThlLeJhvg,1,Terrible service and nothing is free. They even charge you $45 for your carry on! My mom was coughing and we had to pay $3 to but a bottle of water for her. They wouldn't even give a little water to a coughing old lady.
2011-12-17,Spirit Airlines,VqsRq0BTHfwre4KzNP-_Qg,1,"Awful.  Just awful.  Paying this much money to be treated like cattle.  I do not recommend this airline to say the least.  It didn't ruin my trip but just frustrating.  I waited until now, the next morning to finish this.  :|

Part 4: UPDATE: Finally get on plane. Finally depart.  Finally land.  Sit at gate since it's not clear for us to enter for half an hour.  

Part 3 UPDATE:  We board the plane.  We close up the plane, go over safety precautions and exit methods, we clear for departure, and BAM!  It is announced we need to rotate the front tire so we need to depart the plane for a little over an hour while they rotate said tire.  So we de-board, are offered not as far as a FREE WATER or cup of coffee.  Wonderful.

Part 2 UPDATE: Airline changed the gate and didn't tell those of us who had been sitting there for an hour.  Fantastic.  Not a single stewardess or desk attendant in sight.  NO ONE to answer questions!  Or mention that our departure time had been delayed!

Part 1:
OH, you found a great deal online for Spirit...?
BEWARE the bait and switch!  

Beware the 3 dollars for water!
Beware the 10 dollars more to choose your seats!
Beware the FORTY DOLLARS for a single carry on!  My carry on's cost more than my ticket!

Beware this shoddy, lackadaisical airline.  May it either wise up and treat the customers right or may it CLOSE."
2011-12-19,Spirit Airlines,WEsGk37HLy7H17aZep2qnQ,1,"U have got to be kidding me! Just like everyone says, its cheap...but u get what u pay for. Got a 120 round-trip ticket from lax to Vegas and thought all was well. Gum on my seat both ways, planes and ARM rests make these weird screeching noises, it literally sounded like the shocks on the plane were about to go out. Now there is 100 of  us sitting on a plane waiting to go home...and just like another review said, we r waiting for PILOTS!!! Really??? How does 100 people get on a plane without pilots. After the 45 u have to pay for a carry on bag, that's right something that fits in the overhead compartment, it would have been the same price and way easier to take southwest. First and last time I fly this shitty airline, unbelievable!"
2011-12-27,Spirit Airlines,KZwrc-EBd4Ck8OTi1uqFaQ,1,"booked a quick flight for 2, but my husband got tix to a show so had to change flight to arrive earlier.. there were no other flights to get us at destination early, so had to book on anther airline and cancel this flight with over a month notice.  I expect to see a small cancellation fee, but $230 fee on a $400 flight is INSANE!!!!!!
Then they give your 60 days to use the small credit you do receive..  I should have went with my instincts and stayed clear of the 'to good to be true' fairs.  THEY ARE! 
$18 to pick your seat?  $20 for ONE carry on?!!  They should change name to WTF air.  
maybe only fly if short flight, and you do not care where you sit, and you dont need luggage (carry on or check luggage), and you know you wont cancel - then maybe fly them.   
They should take a lesson from southwest- a bargain carrier that doesn't treat you like a complete idiot."
2011-12-27,Spirit Airlines,TzeurNAER8Md4FUaOK4kWA,1,"I held back last time to make sure I was basing my experience on what I had, not just thought because of other people experienced. 

First problem took 6 calls to get my plane tickets.
Second problem, was they didn't understand what I wanted. Ordered my plane tickets for the wrong day. They never sent a confirmation letter. I thought I saw it- my mistake it was the wife's.  However them ordering for the wrong day is theirs- fixing as a one time courtesy- on Christmas EVE, BAH HUMBUG!

Third problem, fixing this will fix the other problems. I only understood half of what they were saying. To fix this they need to.....bring the jobs stateside!

The luggage issue I can work with it and get around it but not the other parts. 

LANGUAGE BARRIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2011-12-30,Spirit Airlines,pgZpszyX-4HRW9UA6oAYrw,2,"We flew Spirit Air roundtrip San Diego to Las Vegas.  We waited too long to get our tickets on Southwest, so Spirit Airlines was half the price.

Similar to budget European airlines I've flown in the past (RyanAir & GermanWings) but the planes are SMALLER.  I'm 5'6"" and a size 10 and my knees touched the whole time.  See others' photos!  I cannot imagine being on this airplane if I was any taller than 5'6""... big guys beware!

If you do choose to fly Spirit, be prepared by: (1) knowing how much you will be paying for extras (checking bags, etc.) and get the BIG FRONT SEAT, (2) mentally prepping yourself to be crammed into a small space, (3) Eat & drink beforehand or pay a lot, (4) Don't plan on being comfortable during the flight-- find a way to mentally zone out for an hour and you will be fine.  I wouldn't choose to fly Spirit again, but possibly in a pinch.  I would NEVER use them for a flight that is over 1 hour.  I would definitely PAY EXTRA FOR THE BIG FRONT SEAT if I do this again.

Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11"
2012-01-01,Spirit Airlines,vDKWdImYL1vg0bbfprMGaQ,1,"NO Stars!!!!! Our flight from Las Vegas to Detroit was delayed for almost 6 hrs... Their reason... Our plane coming in from San Diego is experiencing terrible weather...well I'll be damned...of course with my handy dandy Iphone I checked the weather in SD...sunny in the 70s, not even a cloud!!!! So what theyre trying to do is save money by combining our not completely full flight with a later flight. Such disrespect for people's time! Im not wishing them prosperity this year, that's for sure. What a way to start the year! Today is January 1st 2012...im never flying this airline ever again because not only do they lie and give a totally stupid reason for it, the plane itself is filthy, ultra tight, my husband who is 5'11 had his knees totally against the seat in front of him. They charge for a carry on and checked bags at a ridiculously hiked up price! Be better off with another airline, this is the first and last time I'm flying this joke of an airline!"
2012-01-18,Spirit Airlines,vjoTw1L60XgzoZ4CyqnFfA,1,"Terrible, must be new at flying a plane, thought we were going to crash. Best to upgrade to a bigger seat. You may think you're saving money but it's really not worth it at all and they charge you for a carry on."
2012-01-21,Spirit Airlines,WKVXVJxmSiXTXoBuc9-Phg,1,"Wow. For the first memorable time in 5 years as a Yelper I really want to give a 0-star review. This goes for the entire Spirit Airlines company, not just the Las Vegas branch.

1. The problems start with advertising. Fares advertised super low attract many new customers, and likely, non-repeat customers. That is true for my entire group of 6. We all bought $51 round-trip tickets from Oakland to Las Vegas, thinking it was such a steal. No problems booking through Orbitz. Then we find out by going to the Spirit website that there are CARRYON baggage fees. Seriously, wtf? Ok, my bf and I will share one luggage, check it in (which is actually cheaper than carrying it on, by $2 if pre-paid), and our flight is still cheaper than Southwest or Jetblue.

2. Thinking we were all squared away, about 3 weeks before our flight, we get a notice of a flight change, to an earlier time in the morning instead of afternoon as originally scheduled. Slightly inconvenient as we all now have to take the day off work, which is money that could've been made. Fortunately most of our work schedules are flexible. We did not complain to Sprint.

3. About 1.5 weeks before the flight, we got another email saying our flight was changed AGAIN, this time to 6 AM! With 80% of our group coming from San Jose, and Oakland being an hour away, that would require them to leave at 4 AM by the latest. We raised a huge racket, complained on social media and phone calls, and got them to refund one way for everyone except my bf and I (at first they only wanted to give airline CREDIT -- HELL NO, the point of us canceling the flight is because we hate this airline and it's unreliability and extra fees, and we don't intend to ever fly Spirit again!). Everyone else booked a Southwest flight later in the morning. Despite being a week before the flight, it was still only something like $59 one way, and free luggage!

4. My bf and I kept the 6 AM flight, thinking it wasn't too big a deal and we were both taking the day off anyways. Got to the flight counter at 5:15 AM to drop off our luggage and were greeted by a very rude staff. We waited a few minutes while there was obviously one staff who was not doing anything, had to take out a couple pounds from our luggage (40 lb limit, lower than other airlines), and the staff said, ""The counter is already closed. You're late. So basically, HURRY UP.""

5. Ran through security, ran to the gate, and got checked in. The counter was not closed and there were people still boarding. Overhead bins were mostly empty, the chairs were old and grungy, and the legroom was practically nonexistent (and I'm 5'3"").

6. Everything after that was ok, until the return back. We got to the airport and our gate on time, and our boarding time came and went without any announcements or anything happening. The plane was at the gate, so what could be wrong? One of our friends went to the desk and asked what was going on, and they said, ""There's a delay. We don't know. We work for YOU, not for the airline."" (wtf?)

7. FINALLY, 1.5 hours later, they allow us to board. We were a little concerned about not having been told anything and thought maybe this was the last day of our lives. =P Just before takeoff, the captain comes on the intercom and says, ""Today's delay was brought to you by...an oil check. It took 10 minutes for the oil check and over an hour to find someone to sign off on it. We apologize for the delay."" Wow, talk about inefficiency. I'll give it to the captains though on both flights...they were the only seemingly knowledgeable, friendly, and competent people we've dealt with (directly or indirectly) at this entire company.

8. Same old gray and dirty leather seats with nonexistent legroom (felt sorry for my over 6-foot-tall friend, who declared he'll probably just stick with Southwest and Virgin). 

9. Got to our destination in one piece, picked up our luggage, which now had a large dent in it, and went home around 1 AM, much too tired to complain about anything anymore.

And that is the story of 6 people's first and LAST time with Spirit Airlines. Hardly save any money, and flying Southwest or Virgin will spare you much more headache, discomfort, and rude service. Notice how all the employees at Southwest are so much friendlier and seem happier? Southwest hired all the good ones away."
2012-01-21,Spirit Airlines,nS0Cel_ZKFS6TDUN7uNrMQ,1,"I must apologize in advance as this review will be extremely short and will link to someone else's. The reason is that I am currently writing a very thorough letter to Yelp to enable 0 star ratings for this business. For more info on our experiences (I went with a group of 6), check out this review (http://www.yelp.com/biz/spirit-airlines-las-vegas#hrid:zvZRzf_Jf_fZvOwCw0SdkQ). If Spirit doesn't win the coveted award for ""Worst Business in History."" I'll have zero faith in humanity. Heck, I am more than willing to join the Occupy Spirit movement if there is one starting.

BTW, major props to the person who took the picture of the ""Escape"" sign. That's what you'll want to do after learning they charge $30 (cheapest fee) for carry-on luggage."
2012-01-25,Spirit Airlines,ALLnP63DXutHRsrOyf4-5w,2,"I think it's hilarious that I check Yelp reviews before I chose a place to eat.....But, I didn't even think to check before I booked my recent flight to Vegas. I am not a picky traveler. But, I agree with the vast majority of review.  It was hard to sit through the short flight to Vegas and I had to argue that I could put my bag under the seat and not pay the extra fee for my carry on. Yes....you heard me. Extra fee to place your luggage in the overhead bin. Although, it looks cheap, unless you've got a short flight, short legs, and no luggage-It's not worth it."
2012-01-25,Spirit Airlines,3Imydqays_O4wUZn3RMeIQ,3,"Under the Yelp guidelines, 3* a stretch. Yet hear me out.  

Flew super cheap from Dallas - Vegas.  They offer a $9 deal if you join their Spirit Club (*$60 annually).  Wife joined & can now book tickets for us both.  Many other reviews below detail the a la carte nature of the airline.  You've seen that.  Yes, if you don't want to pay $3 for bottled water, carry your airport drink onto the plane. BTW- they do have a 3 beer special (discount priced) !

For our recent Vegas flight, outbound trip departed at 1120 pm, about a half hour late.  Newer-looking Airbus--bad news--seats were as tight as advertised.  Because this was essentially a red eye flight, there were empty seats; even a few empty rows.  However we didn't have the good sense to scurry to an empty row when the doors closed.  Hence my wife stayed jammed up against the 6'4"" guy who had to literally straddle the seat in front of him (truly, just sitting upright was not an option).  Pilot & attendants had poor speaking voices; intercom was way too loud for a middle-of-the-night-flight; attendants were a tad rude; 

Return flight, older Airbus, seats appeared more spacious.  Flight was totally full.  Crew was nicer this time as well.

Why the A-Ok?  Because we got to go to Vegas!  This trip was totally enabled by de minimis airfare, including one carry on bag fee.  Would we fly again? Yes.  Do we have our expectations locked in for next time? Absolutely.

Tip:  As soon as the doors close--scurry to any open seats. If you don't like sitting 3-to-a-row & have a flight longer than 90mins (as our 2:45 Vegas flight was), look to move.  Don't pay for your seat selection, because it won't do anything.  There is a row or two of bigger seats in the front for $65...if you're really motivated."
2012-01-31,Spirit Airlines,ov8hvXcThAEZDf-ujQ-GCw,1,"Horrible! Flight was canceled 15 mins before take off due to mechanical issues. I  had a feeling that was going to happen since the plane never showed up. In addition, I had to stand in line for an hour just to get a refund. Some people had to take flights the next day since they were fully book the rest of the day, but I wasn't about to ride on a potentially dangerous plane. Good thing i booked a flight with southwest while waiting in line, which was an hour later than what would've been my departure time with spirit. 

Spirit did offer a $50 voucher for my next flight, but required me purchase a round trip ticket, which I wouldn't risk having another incident like this happen to me again...no thanks!"
2012-02-10,Spirit Airlines,NLlBmP25RnWcqralXEhdkg,1,"Worst ever.

I will never, ever, ever, ever if I can help it fly Spirit Airlines again.  I can't even explain the disappointment.  It started when we were waiting in line to check our baggage.  There was an elderly lady in front of us with multiple bags, and two dogs.  She was trying to pile everything up to be weighed and someone in the line stepped out to help her.  Then when she was done they weighed it and they told her that the conveyor belt was broken and she had to deliver everything to a separate area.  They didn't have anyone help her and an additional person who was going to start going through security stepped out of line and helped her again.  It was just so disappointing.  We had to deal with the cranky staff where we had to pay to check any bags in and also pay to take one carry on..so sad.  After that we finally were able to get through security.  We got on the flight to find out that the seats were extremely tiny, they tried to sell you the shirts of their backs, and you had to pay for water. I could have paid the same amount of money for a better company considering I had to pay for every step I took.  I am surprised you didn't have to purchase tokens to use to bathroom!"
2012-02-13,Spirit Airlines,X36xrJcvEXFkexqr5StYrQ,2,"Charges, Charges, and more charges.  Cramped quaarts on these plans and they charge for everything.  Only use spirt if you HAVE to."
2012-02-13,Spirit Airlines,sYOvTwKkLPfGr03akFCTPg,3,"Going into this you have to understand you are getting a CHEAP flight... and with that i suggest you do a little research and this will make it all worth while.  Figure out how to pack your luggage into a small carry on.  Pre print your ticket (dont pay for a seat choice just let the cards fall where they may) bring your own snacks and water from airport and you are good to go.  I signed up and recieved like 17000 free miles which translates into 5 one way tickets.. 
Again know that you are ordering a ham sandwich here folks... and you will be happy with the ham sandwich.. dont expect the steak ;)"
2012-02-20,Spirit Airlines,-pums7RGV7ENsozb5Z-cyQ,3,"After all the worry generated by reading the terrible reviews for Spirit, my trip was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.  I am not the World's Greatest Flier and am very partial to Alaska Air.  I wanted to cancel my reservation after reading the reviews on here.  I am glad that I didn't!    

There wasn't a thing wrong with our trip.  We flew  from Portland to Vegas on Feb 15th.  Everyone we came into contact with, from the Rapid Drop Off Baggage Clerk, to the gate attendants and flight attendants, were helpful and friendly.  

The fees-----the majority of airlines charge fees to check baggage now.  Spirit was comparable, I believe it was $25/bag and the bag had to weigh 40 pounds or less.   Roll your clothes or watch one of the many videos on You Tube to learn how to pack a lot into a bag. My husband and I packed enough for 4 days in one checked bag.  That included shoes and dress clothes.  I also took a good-sized carry on and a large handbag and did not have any issues.  PLAN AHEAD.  If you don't, it's your own fault, not the fault of the airlines---their fees are not hidden.

We paid $13 extra (each) for their Big Front Seats.  WELL WORTH THE $$!  Waaaay more leg room and we were not jammed up against each other.  Very comfortable.  I will book these seats again.  It was the most comfortable I have ver been on a plane.

Yes, they charge for food/drinks.  Credit/Debit only, no cash.  You can buy something from the airport and carry it on, but the price won't be much different.  

The plane was an Airbus, it seemed in good condition to me.  It was clean.  I am a germophobe and didn't feel like I had to sanitize everything....

They did change our flight times well in advance--approx 1 hour change each way.

Overall, very good price to Vegas. Decent flights, decent service, nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate.  I will not hesitate to fly Spirit again, as long as the price is less than other airlines."
2012-02-27,Spirit Airlines,al-7uq9eC8hg4xytEheN1g,1,"They should call it Nickel and Dime Airline they charge you for every individual thing carry ons starting at $20 each heaven forbid you need to take actual luggage up to $60 each way, crappy on flight airline service. I will never fly with them again"
2012-03-02,Spirit Airlines,trQWF6jE4MJZ_UiDrPs2VQ,3,"I gave it 3 stars for the price.  What can you really expect from an airline that charges you $40 round trip before taxes?  If you're expecting the red carpet treatment or even just same amenities as the other airlines, you're out of your damn mind.  It is true that you get what you pay for.  You want more leg room, pay for it.  You want a more comfortable seat, pay for it.  You want a plane not to smell like baby poop, THEN PAY FOR IT.  I worked for an airline once upon a time so I guess I'm biased.

With that being said HOLY CR*P is this plane ghetto!!!!!  My butt falls asleep every time I fly on Spirit and mind you I only fly for an hour and a half every time.  It's really annoying that they charge you for everything but again, look how much you paid for your flight. I can say the ticket counter people are nice in OAK and horrible in LAS.  I had this one Latin ***** who wasn't helpful at all when I left important documents on the plane. She called down to the plane ONCE and asked them nonchalantly to look for my folder. I asked her to call again and even begged for a gate pass.  I was crying my eyes out because I knew I left them in the seat pocket in front of my seat and she made it seem like someone took them and they were gone forever.  I walked in to baggage to make a lost and found claim and the baggage agent ran to the plane and found my folder. WHAT AN AWESOME HUMAN BEING and the epitome of a good employee.  I couldn't thank him enough!

Would I fly spirit if I could find a comparable priced airline ticket at anyone other airline? No.  But since I can't, I'll continue to fly Spirit."
2012-03-11,Spirit Airlines,0eD__RRZMAJF7LvzJp6Mag,1,I'll never fly Spirit again! No matter the price. I'm surprised they don't charge to use the bathroom! Nickle and dime on everything. There is a dent my knee from the seat in front of me.
2012-03-12,Spirit Airlines,qPguPpt4L9rTmLoYeBLy2w,1,No carry on bags? Paid $70 round trip for my tiny suitcase - this charge makes Spirit just as costly as everyone else. The planes are dirty.

2012-04-04,Spirit Airlines,52OWdj6njaNe0vNjDh4l-g,1,"Seriously, the worst flight experience EVER.  I didn't pay for this flight my work booked it otherwise I would have gone with an airline I've actually heard of, but we did get to and from Vegas safely and for that I'm thankful.  I did end up reimbursing my company for what I paid for my husband's flight and for that price we could have flown with a real airline.  The only things that are free on this airline are ""Ice, Napkins, and a smile.""  Yes, this is a quote from the stewardess on board.  Roundtrip one check-in bag will cost you $66 if you book before you get to the airport, but less than 24 hours in advance.  My hubby accidentally booked a check-in and a carry-on for one way instead of booking a checkin for both directions and even though we didn't use the check-ins they refuse to give us our money back.  Seriously, not cool.  Will not fly again!"
2012-04-06,Spirit Airlines,mvx1X9ugyljaFMwTHecNfw,1,"My husband and I went to Vegas for my spring break from nursing school, which was supposed to be nice and relaxing, but ended up being a complete nightmare on the day we were supposed to fly back home. Our original flight from Chicago left without much incidence and i wasn't going to complain about certain things, but now that my experience was so horrendous, I'm going to list it all.

Bags - all bags, checked and unchecked are extra. If your bag is over 40 pounds, there's another fee for that (most airlines give you 50 pound limits).

Seats - the seats are literally benches with seat backs attached. Seats don't recline and you are forced into a completely upright position for the entire flight unless you want to pay extra for the couple of seats that do recline. Ridiculous. Our flight left chicago at 10:30 pm and arrived in Vegas at midnight Vegas time (which was 2am Chicago time...needless to say, we were exhausted and our backs hurt).

Flight drinks and food - ALL at an extra charge. Even water and pop.

Ok, that was my major complaints BEFORE our return flight home.

On 4/5/12, we arrived at the airport 2 hours before our flight to find out that our flight was CANCELLED. Best part was nobody was addressing us or answering our questions. They just kept saying, you have to wait in this line that wasn't moving. I kept hearing from other people down the line that the soonest they'd be able to get us home was 4/8/12 in the afternoon. That's three more days of hotel and food in Vegas (NOT cheap), and they were offering us a $50 flight voucher for future flights for our ""trouble."" No offer of payment for food and hotel for 3 MORE DAYS.

After asking if they needed my information, I was told no, only to find out from a supervisor 10 minutes later that they did indeed need my info to help us. The communication and customer service was a mess. They kept saying they'd get back to us and to go have a seat and wait and that they'd get it ""figured out."" We arrived at the airport at 12:20 Vegas time and didn't have an answer about whether or not we'd be able to get home until 2:20 Vegas time. In the meantime, we're trapped in the desert with no water and no access to food until they can get it fixed.

Once we were transferred over to an American Airlines flight, things went much more smoothly, but the way things were handled by Spirit was horrendous. They claimed they had contacted all the passengers, but the only contact I had recieved was a missed phone call from a number I didn't recognize and no message. Our flight was cancelled because supposedly hail punched 12 holes into the body of the plane that we were supposed be be flying on. Makes you wonder about the craftmanship of their plains if hail can put 12 holes into their air carriers.

Needless to say, I will NEVER fly with spirit again. This situation was handled very poorly, and I have heard from other spirit customers, including friends of mine, that this is par for the course for this company. Why are they even still in business? Once you pay for all the extras they charge you, you're flight is not going to be any cheaper than they other air carriers."
2012-04-06,Spirit Airlines,efnwvoN60xtddn7LwOWtIQ,1,"if you are unsure of your travel plans/might cancel a flight, don't do spirit.
nonrefundable, no-sympathy people at the phones, they even offered to cancel my $75 flight with a $125 cancellation fee. what...?"
2012-04-19,Spirit Airlines,GdPOFk3M73SqgKnywD6jPw,1,"Reasons why my flight with Spirit from Las Vegas to Portland was the worst flying experience I've ever had: 

- Ridiculous baggage fees. Ended up paying $35 for my carry on. I mean, come on.
- My flight got delayed for an hour and a half, which caused me to take the taxi home instead of the train (an additional $25 expense.)
- Since I got back to Portland at around 1:40 AM (and got back home at around 2:30), I only got an hour of sleep before getting up for work (I really do not recommend going to work with only one hour of sleep.)
- One of the flight attendants ran over my foot with the beverage/food cart and didn't even apologize (and woke me up from my nap!)

I kind of wish I just spent the extra $50 or so for a Southwest flight. Never again."
2012-04-29,Spirit Airlines,cFv3zEvoRkPmZFIBHIM-Uw,4,I used to visit LAS all the time. It's been awhile and I booked a flight/hotel w/Spirit! A reasonable tour package! Like 1/2 the fare on the competition.  I flew w/them before and it was a great bus ride. Just stuff your stuff under the seat. They lose a star because it's been my experience that  there are 6 wheelchairs on and 2 off!?! It must be what happens in  Las Vegas! A jackpot!
2012-04-29,Spirit Airlines,tu7CWqfzv_tqc-FWsQUSRg,1,"Never Never Never travel this airlines.  They boast to be the lowest prices, but the hidden fees are off the wall.  I will never travel them again.  

My experience was that I purchased tickets and I had no idea that if I did not make my first leg of the trip I would not be able to use the return.  I understand after that happen and I have acknowledged that it was my fault, but they were not will to help at all.  I ended up purchasing an additional ticket to get on the flight returning to my destination and when I was going to take a carry on (just one) they charge me $40.  What?!?  If I wanted to check it, it would have been $38.  When I finally got on board the flight attendants were not the nicest and beverages were $3.  

I guess the old saying was correct that you get what you pay for, but I ended up paying a lot for a crappy experience.  TERRIBLE!

I plan to write a letter to the company listing my grievances of this horrible trip.  NEVER AGAIN!!!"
2012-04-30,Spirit Airlines,-xzFoX73t-zfRea_LKUNkA,1,"Spirit likes to tout itself as being the US's first ultra low cost airlines - or something like that.  You would think I would have it duly memorized since during both legs of my trip, the flight attendant came on like every 5 minutes to brag about it.  And to harass you into signing up for their exclusive Visa.  And the continual announcements with the full cabin lights on, take place at 1:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m.  Apparently, they would have to charge you extra if you actually were able to fall asleep fully upright in the world's most uncomfortable seat built.  Spirit Airlines must have consulted with some sort of S&M design group when they engineered their seating.  I think they took a concrete bench from HomeDepot and slapped some faux-leather grey canvas on it, and voila, a seat was born.  Just to drive this point home:  I am a hair over 5 feet tall (maybe 5-1 if I have a great yoga or Pilates Reformer session) and weigh about 105 pounds, and this was undoubtedly, the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my life.  I felt cramped, pinched and claustrophobic.

And if you are thinking, well, they are a low cost airline, of course, the seats and amenities cannot be luxurious, what can you expect?  Bottom line, they are not as low cost as they portray themselves and their version of cheap actually comes topped off with equally bad service .  So, you pay more than you expected and suffer while not saving anything.  So, they are indeed the double whammy of awful.

As others have mentioned their hidden fees are ridiculous and the staff are about as unpleasant as they come.  I was a few pounds over the 40 pound limit and was told in LV that I could transfer some of my things out of my checked bag into my purse, but I would have to re-wait back in the full line again when it had already taken me over 30 minutes to reach the counter.  And by this point, the line was even longer.  So, I ended up having to pay another $ 25 for my checked bag.  Total cost of checking 1 bag roundtrip $ 91!

After I came home, I re-researched my roundtrip flight (LV to DFW) and in the end, after all their crappy fees, it would have been cheaper for me to have flown another (more reputable) airline.

It was my first and last Spirit trip."
2012-05-07,Spirit Airlines,tJIlqGJeK1zuOsyr4QxnVg,1,"Because of the cheap fares, I expected cramped seats, old planes, and no free drinks or snacks, but Spirit brings it to a whole new level.  They actively and knowingly try and deceive customers by adding fees anywhere they can and have HORRIBLE customer service.  If you need to get an issue resolved, you won't be successful, and you'll probably have to spend hours on hold before reaching someone who will give you the runaround.

Spirit Airlines is an evil company, it is worth spending more money to fly a different carrier."
2012-05-11,Spirit Airlines,2UePZVvd1NEjyH5rnm7dOA,1,"Flew back on this rat trap of an airline(greyhound bus). Took it back from Vegas to SD for $130. The same price it cost to fly out on Southwest. So call budget/discount airline? Really translates out to be an old broken down plane inside and out. Got on the plane ,went to my assigned seat and was shoehorned into my seat( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w?select=9c4j6QliYorEUzS3qmhtyg#9c4j6QliYorEUzS3qmhtyg  ). Then they announced there would be a  20 min hold up for mechanical issue , good start.

Before the flight I  ran into a buddy coming back from Vegas and he said his flight on Friday was held up for a 3 hour delay for mechanical issues , he had to re book on Southwest to get out to Vegas.

The inside of the plane was well worn and my  seat and my friends seats were broken , seems like they put in a couple extra rows of seats to increase there profits.

Once the mechanical issue was taken care of  , the plane started moving and when they engaged the flaps on the wings a 2 min loud screeching sound went on and again when we landed, excellent.

Almost forgot on there website and when printing out my ticket at the airport they try to trick you into sign up for there $9 Fare Club(  annual membership fees are non-refundable.). During the process it pops up at least 4 times. Then when I was printing my ticket at the airport they asked again. Good times having to double check every move you make on there website to make sure they aren't tricking you into buy something you don't want!

If you 5 foot tall, have no luggage,  you will enjoy this vending machine airline.

Will never fly on this crap hole airline again!"
2012-05-12,Spirit Airlines,xTnHLIpc8X7-OuKBXoE4yg,4,"first yelp review ever and i been on this thing for a couple years... i was actually pleasantly surprised with spirit, so ill write them a review for hookin me up.. i actually got an awesome deal with spirit going LV - Denver for their first week of service to Denver.. so check it out..

im usually an LV-LA southwest passenger, but i been lookin at spirit lately cuz they have $20 ea way tickets most of the time, but held up getting it cuz ive been using all my SW rapid reward points this whole time.. finally expired so spirit it is.. 

i signed up for their $9 fare program since i do fly a lot.. check up on prices.. i found a vegas to denver round trip for under $60!!!!! thats right, under $60!!! u cant even find a 1 way for that cheap! so i said eff it... i dont care where i sit, if they gon take me to denver for under $30 each way ill sit with the luggage for all i care... hahaha i mean how bad can it really be? im going to denver and back for cheaper than a full tank of gas, i really cant complain about anything... 

so basically.. im expecting the worst of the worst real shitty service and all that.. but it was actually not bad at all.. the planes (seats i should say) were even better than southwest... more room, and the aircraft was only half full so i had a empty seat next to me... if SW and spirit were the same price and spirit didnt do all that gay stuff wit the charging of extra bags i'd take spirit every time.. the only thing that southwest really has a leg up on spirit is the CHARGING OF THE EXTRA BAGS.. the keyword there is EXTRA... cuz i flew with a pretty large carry on (enough clothes for about a weekend) and there wasnt any problem at all.. (i also stuffed a backpack in there too so when i get out i could put the backpack on, im smart i know) 

yea spirit charges extra for like pretty much everything but theres lots of ways to avoid them and id say its definitely worth it considering how cheap i got my tickets for..  like for instance.. 

Spirit charges you $5 to print your boarding pass at the ticketing counter.. but to avoid the $5 charge u simply just check in at 1 of those self service kiosks... AWESOME.. it encourages ppl to use the kiosk which speeds checking in by at least half the time.. i think every airline really should do that too... 

Spirit charges you for extra carry-on bags and bags... i flew for a 4 day trip to denver, stuffed everything into 1 bag (including my backpack) and boarded the plane no problem, no extra fees.. 


even tho everybody says spirit charges for everything, they do... but i didnt pay a penny more than my original airfare ticket which came out to sum like $57.58... but from VEGAS to DENVER for under $60 round trip ill take that any day of the week... oh and i also finally booked my LV - LA trip also next week after i finally figured out Spirit is the SHIIIET.. def recommend.. im def flyin spirit again... come on $60 round trip to denver sale... come by again!!! im waitin!!!"

2012-05-16,Spirit Airlines,7RBQ7WnXDcz59nc00ovf9w,1,"I apologize in advance for the profane language i intend to use in this review. If I could give zero stars, I would! 
This review is for the Spirit Customer service only, most especially directed at manager Josh ""Anderson""( who i know gave me a false name).
While waiting for a cab to take my friends and I to the airport for our return flight, one of my friends suddenly had a severe allergic reaction. Hives, swollen tongue, swelling all over, and possibly breathing issues. 911 was called, the fire dept and an ambulance came and she was taken to the ED. 
As she was getting treated in the hospital, I decided to call customer service to see what I could do to change our flight as we were definitely not going to make it. I spoke to someone (I forgot his name, but almost as rude) and explained my situation and all he kept saying over and over again like a mantra, was how they can't do anything except give me a refund, which after all their extra fees were deducted, would come out to $12.79 
It was either that or forfeit everything. I explained that this was a medical emergency. I obviously could not leave a friend while she was in the emergency department in a different state, but this obviously had no effect on him whatsoever. 
I asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to the idiotically rude asshole Josh Anderson. I relayed my situation again and still got the same answer. I asked what I could do, what he could help me do and he had the audacity to tell me to catch my flight by myself if I really needed to leave. I asked him to find me the next available flight out, and he gave me some absurd time the next day and the day after with an absurd amount. I had had it. I asked to speak to a different person, he said no, he is as far as I get to speak to. He then goes on to tell me that if I don't make my flight and don't cancel it now with him I will lose my refund of 12.79 for my flight. Well I wish I could have told him to shove his measly $12.79 refund up his ass with a spiked bat, but I didn't. What am I going to do with $13 when he's charging me a one way fare price of almost $300. 
I asked him to transfer me to the spirit ticket counter (I didn't know at the time that they don't take calls but I'm sure he knew as well) and guess where this motherfucking asshole gave me the number to....custodial services. Well, message received loud and clear Josh Anderson! Thanks for making me feel like shit while waiting for a friend in the hospital and pissing me off. I hope you get everything you deserve and more!
Even the custodian apologized on your behalf, was more helpful than you were and told me there was no number and that I was being fucked with and to just come to the airport and they can help me out.
I ended up going to the airport while my friend was still in the hospital to sort everything out and the lady at the ticket counter thankfully helped me out.
I had no problem with the flight, in fact, my return red eye was one of the smoothest flights I had ever been on. 
However, this was the first and definitely the last flight I would ever take on spirit. I will happily shell out more money for AA or united any day. I had heard terrible things about spirit airline before, but never excepted this kind of insolent treatment. Never again!!"
2012-05-17,Spirit Airlines,-HqHpgckah745V5yXTA1og,1,"If I could give zero stars, I would. 

Since when do we have to pay for a carry-on bag??!! And $40 to boot!! I also had to pay an extra $25, on top of the usual $40, for my checked bag because it was over 40 lbs. I thought the standard was 50 lbs. As a woman who travels for 7 or more days at a time, my bag is always over 40 lbs., but always under 50 lbs. And FYI, as of November 2012, all of the bag fees are going up.

They also charge for beverages in flight, including water. 

I will never fly Spirit again because in the end it will cost just as much as the next airline."
2012-05-21,Spirit Airlines,Idf6rezD72IT8ea94JMHPg,1,"Wish you could give 1/2 a star! Worst airlines I have ever used. Flight to Vegas was delayed due to maintenance while we were siting on it trying to taxi and now trying to fly home, again delayed due to maintenance. They charge you for everything and limit your check bag to 40lbs. God for bid you need water on the flight cause it will cost you. The planes are very old and not clean, coffee stains running down the trays and during the flight the floatation device fell out of the bottom the seat. Little sketchy Spirit, little sketchy!"
2012-05-29,Spirit Airlines,-BiU1Rzh8FyhANBs8N9U8g,1,"Spirit was the cheapest airfare I found for a last minute flight from LAX to the Bay Area, and now I understand why. My flight costed me only $64, as compared to other airlines who were charging $180+, but...I have a three hour layover in Vegas, which by the way, is where I am drafting this review as I wait to board my next plane to Oakland. Some might say time is money, but I didn't really mind the layover. Besides now I have a few extra hours to catch up on my reviews. 

So why the two stars? Oh where do I begin...

When I checked-in online, I found that you are only allowed one personal bag (handbag, small backpack, etc.) free of charge and that they charge $35 for a carry-on, and even more for checked bags. But on that same page, they disclose that umbrellas, baby diaper bags, cameras, or food for the flight are not counted as carry-ons. I had an SLR camera bag and a handbag with me and was heading straight to the airport immediately after work, so I couldn't even go home to pack smarter after learning of their baggage fees. Since cameras were not counted as a carry on, I pulled out all the compartment walls from my camera bag to make one big compartment for my handbag. Luckily I had brought my denim LV bag, so it was much more pliable than most bags I have at home, and I carried my camera around my neck. 

So I got around the baggage fee, but then the next page of the online check-in asks you to select a seat for a fee starting at $5. This page almost got me. It says that the green seat is me, grey seats are unavailable, and blue seats are available for purchase/upgrade. I looked up and down the diagram of the plane multiple times, but did not see my seat anywhere. I thought I just had to pick a seat, but anywhere that I clicked on added an additional fee for the seat. My gosh! They charge for carry-on and seats??? Anyway, I decided to skip this step just to see what happens and they randomly assigned me to a seat. I usually prefer the window, but whatevers. I just saved myself $5-15. 

Finally, the flight. The plane itself looked pretty new and clean. Leg room wise... like what most people say... are minimal, if any. Lucky for me, I'm not even five feet of height, so there was enough leg room for me. The seats don't recline either, but you probably wouldn't want them to anyway because as Queen Latifah would say in Last Holiday, the person in front of you would practically be sitting in your lap. 

Since my fare was so cheap, and I had a layover in Vegas, I was curious to see what the cost of the fare would be to just fly from LAX to LAS (the first flight of my travel). I found that the fare costed $100 more than mine!!! So for my fellow flyers who were stopping in Vegas, they could've booked the LAX to OAK, got off in LAS, and disregard the flight to OAK. But I've heard that then you wouldn't be able to board the returning flight obviously because you're not returning from OAK, so all you have to do is book separate one-way departing and returning flights. 

(Lol... as I'm sitting at the gate waiting, a woman just walked by calling Spirit stupid.)

**UPDATE**
Three hours later, I'm still here in Vegas. And now my flight is delayed two hours. My plane is here, but we're waiting for the flight crew to come in from San Diego. Wtf happened to the crew on the plane that is sitting here at the gate? Now I'm not getting back to the Bay Area till the next morning at 12:40.  Awesome! I'm knocking off a star.

**ANOTHER UPDATE**
Finally got on the second plane and was not impressed. The plane looked old and dirty. Completely opposite of the first plane. To the point where it was gross. I'm just glad it got me to OAK safely."
2012-05-30,Spirit Airlines,VGPId8wRrg0AXl7-9KW_pw,1,"My experience with Spirit Airlines was atrocious. 

It all began at Las Vegas Airport - we were given no direction while waiting in an incredibly long line to check our bags.  Customers finally realized we were in the wrong line, only to be moved to an equally long line with poor service.  POOR STAFFING - For the record, I was at the airport nearly 2 hours before my scheduled flight. 

I was put on a standby flight that I clearly wasn't going to get on; however, they still ticketed me for this flight while REFUSING to tell me my other options.  When I finally was able to get the other option (ie, my original flight had a connection that I was likely going to miss due to a delay out of Las Vegas), the employee told me the wrong time.  I was under the impression the flight would be leaving its connection city at 1:30pm.  The actual time was closer to 7pm.
    
Six passengers on the flight from Las Vegas to DFW were hoping to make a connection to Chicago in DFW.  Our plane (which was parked at the same gate) left 5 minutes prior to our arrival.  There was no coordination of efforts.
   
Because of this, 6 of us were stranded in DFW for 12 hours with no hotel option.  We were (begrudgingly) given food vouchers.  The supervisor, Carlos Betancourt, was the absolute worst customer service employee I've ever come across.  I hope you strongly consider a re-training of your employees on customer-centric policies and politeness.  As a student of business marketing, I was embarrassed that this sort of behavior is allowed in the airline industry.
    
Carlos B refused to give me his supervisor's name.  I was provided with your 1-800 number - cut off 3 times (it wasn't my phone) just when I was making progress.  The lack of synergy between your corporate and field operations is beyond terrible.
   
I will say, Larissa in DFW (a Spirit staff) was delightful - super nice and understanding.  She deserves a raise!  Perhaps, she could teach the course on customer engagement. 

I personally regret purchasing a ticket from Spirit Airlines - first and last.  In the end, I feel like you guys should refund my ticket (and the 5 other passengers), but I realize that's never going to happen.  Please try harder - in this economic state, you can't just expect to provide sub-par performance and survive."
2012-06-04,Spirit Airlines,DbINZ9YSWnoRB40d1fDQ4w,2,"Five stars for fares, one star for customer service.  Also, if you buy your ticket at  the counter instead of online you back to save more money by avoiding taxes and other fees.  if you look at the rules online you'll know exactly what to bring and what not to bring in order to avoid fees or minimize them.  this airline is also known for constant delays and extremely bad customer service, so just be ready for that expectation.  this airline is ideal for me since its leaves out of mesa arizona how much smaller airport compared to sky harbor.  a round trip ticket cost me 40 dollars.  if you can travel with the backpack that's the way to go they do not charge fees for that.  speak of the devil I was just informed that the flight is gonna be delayed by 1 hour and 40 minutes and this is what you have to put up with.  they lack reliability and customer service for that this company get 2 stars and that is really pushing it.  well at least they gave me this extra time to write this wonderful review while I sit here waiting for my flight!  what can I say get what you pay 4!  only use this airline for casual line if you have to be somewhere at a certain time you better pay some extra money and take a major airline that has a much better track record for on time and departure flights."
2012-06-04,Spirit Airlines,REBZFvIe1n1C_AdAYVP-fw,1,"Ugh. UGH. Never again. Ever. First, I'm a loyal Southwest customer. I've come to value, very highly, their policies and procedures, especially after my experience with Spirit. 

I flew out to Chicago for my cousin's graduation and ended up booked on Southwest to Chicago and on Spirit on the way home (my mom booked and paid for my flights). On the way there, everything was peachy keen. Landed at O'Hare, which Id heard horror stories about, but everything went supersmooth. 

On the way back: Had to go through Midway this time, which was just sucky. Since the only way to check in online and print out one's boarding pass beforehand is to pay extra to pick a seat at the time of booking, I ended up in a short line to do all that at the airport. It took over 45 minutes for the 6 people ahead of me to get through the line. There were 4 agents working at the time. Frustrating, but I'm a very relaxed flier, so I wrote it off. Once I finally got through the line and through security, I had about 40 minutes until boarding. Once at the gate, I realized that there was no information re: flights anywhere. There were no gate agents to be seen, no monitors that could tell me that my flight was delayed, no nothing. I found out that I was delayed through word of mouth from all the other passengers. There were 2 gates in this area, with two flights scheduled. Everyone was confused about which gate they were leaving from, since the gates were written on our boarding passes by the agents at the front desk. I had to keep calling my family to get updates on my flight (no free wifi at Midway!). Eventually, two Spirit employees showed up, with no information. Eventually, boarding was started. It was easily the most chaotic boarding process I've ever seen. There was simply a crush of people trying to hand their boarding passes to the agent. No line, no attempt by the other Spirit employee to organize the crowd. I consider the fact that I got on the correct plane at all to be a minor miracle. 

During the flight, I was thirsty (the two hour delay, coupled with there being no restaurants/stores in the Spirit terminal). However, I was not about to pay for a drink on the flight. Not even an adult beverage; they even charge for water! Ridiculous.

Pretty much: if you purchase a Spirit fare all excited that it's so cheap, it's not. Assuming that you want to carry anything more than a purse/backpack to your destination, print a boarding pass the night before or have a beverage and a bag of peanuts while flying, you'll end up paying at least the difference between the Spirit fare and the next cheapest. It might appear to be a deal, until you get nickeled and dimed to death."
2012-06-04,Spirit Airlines,CNn12eo_LaQkVKxfSM4_3Q,4,"From reading all the reviews I was kinda freaking out about my flight but honestly people it's not that bad.  I flew from LV to San Diego.  I can handle anything for 1 hour.

One thing I notice from the posts is the displeasure of seating room and the extra costs.  The seats are tight - no doubt about that but you can add their roomier seats for something like $13 each way & they're huge.  I sat in the regular seats which weren't great but bearable.  I think you have to put things in perspective.  You get what you pay for.  If you want cheap air you're going to give up a little.

Another thing people complained about is the baggage fees.  If you plan ahead you're good.  Just pay for a checkin bag and you will have no problems. Also, you get a carry on item.  I had a back pack and no one said anything.   Again, this has to do with planning.

I would say if you're looking for a short flight that is half the price of Southwest it's a good deal.  If not then you should book S.W. or some other carrier.  If you are looking for a deal and ""PLAN AHEAD"" then this is a good alternative or if it's last minute you can save a little.  

Now that being said the worst thing I can say is I didn't care for the staff.  No smiles, little bit of attitude etc.  - oh and french accents for the whole staff (kinda annoying).  

The biggest annoyance is the people who sat near me and complained or made snide remarks about the extra costs and fees.  People - you have a choice.  This isn't some third world country where you only have one nationalized airline.  You can book somewhere else.  If you book it deal with it just don't get on a cheap flight acting like you're a priority first class passenger.  You're going cheap know your place.

Hope this helps.  good luck."

I specifically asked, and verifired that it would be a refund onto my card, gave them card number and everything.  Now they're saying it will take another 20-25 days becasue they had to restart my claim. Terrible. Terrible and Terrible."
2012-06-08,Spirit Airlines,BRmmJsrOLz5R0_3vSnKYmg,1,"DO NOT FLY!

I can't even waste time writing paragraphs, I'll just list how awful the experience with Spirit was:

1) Our flight to Vegas was almost canceled - fantastic.
2) Our flight home from Vegas was ""postponed..."" And then consequently canceled.
3) The Spirit concierge rescheduled everyone's flights except ours - when I asked them to do so for us as well, the woman's answer was a flat out lie: ""What do you mean? I didn't book anyone else a flight.""
4) YOU HAVE TO PAY $40 FOR CARRY-ON BAGGAGE.

When I asked the male concierge how they have the audacity to charge for carry-on, he said ""That's why the seats were so cheap.  Just remember, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is."" Great, way to have faith in your company. UGH. Never fly Spirit again!!!!"
2012-06-20,Spirit Airlines,9vnKIlYOKOjKwvETjUcBgA,1,"NEVER AGAIN!!!

Paid more for baggage than the cost of the flight, and that was the least of my concerns.

People on my flight actually screamed out loud, on more than one occasion, because we feared for our lives.
 
I am not a business flyer, but do fly several times a year. This was by far the worst flight I've ever been on. It was terrifying. The staff was self-righteous and down right rude. There was zero knee/leg room. Hidden charges everywhere. I don't know what the guy below me is talking about, because I had to pay $40 to carry-on a bag!

Not only will I NEVER fly this airline again, but I will tell every person I come across of the horrific experience I encountered with this company.

To the Spirit Airlines staff and 'executive' team . . . YOU SUCK!!!"
2012-06-25,Spirit Airlines,-SuRS6k6mLT7G8bXSycf2g,1,I don't fly much but this has got to be the worst airline I have ever been on. The seats are very uncomfortable and not enough space at all. I had an aisle seat and it seemed a lot more narrow than some of the other airlines I have been on. Everytime someone walked by I kept getting bumped into and it wasn't like I was leaning towards the aisle. The seats were very squeaky and the tray tables were in desperate need of some WD-40. Everytime someone would pull it down it would make this loud screech noise that was very annoying. Nothing complimentary on this flight and you have to pay for any drinks or snacks you get. Seats were dirty and had stains all over them and smelled really bad. The flight wasn't as bad but just the overall experience wasn't a great one. I guess you get what you pay for since this is one of the cheaper airlines.
2012-07-23,Spirit Airlines,wWZW1yFtDCDotzpp4d4pPQ,1,"NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE

Wow, I support the other comments: Bad, bad, quality airline. As soon as I was sitting at my seat, I heard my neighbors in front of us complaining about the x-tra prices: Never , never.... If you add up all their supplemental fees it will cost you more then a regular airline carrier.... and, with poor quality service. I will Never, Never, Never fly Spirit Airlines again! I do not know what they are thinking. I am 5'-10"" and sitting back on my seat, my knees are touching the front seat. There is a hump in the middle of the back seat that is hurting me. Only 1 hour to go but next time I will use other airlines carrier to go to Vegas.  The plane pilot looked to be 22 years old, at landing in Oakland, the plane hit the tarmac very hard people were screaming OUCH! when we touched the ground. I did not feel safe."
2012-07-24,Spirit Airlines,hU3Z8JWYWhwLNpGz594F1w,4,"Ok this is SPIRIT. They're not supposed to be Virgin or Emirates or even Southwest. They are the lowest of the low discount carriers (perhaps tied with Allegiant). If you know that going in, and prepare yourself, Spirit offers you the perfect opportunity to take trips that would normally be cost prohibitive. Be warned: the only bag you can take on board without paying is a backpack or a purse. I packed light, got everything in a small backpack, and flew to Phoenix (well, Mesa, actually) for less than $40 ROUNDTRIP and to LAX for $100! That's with taxes, fees, etc! The seats are tight, no doubt, but I even held my 10-month old baby on my lap for both flights, so it's definitely doable.
If you want to carry-on 2 bags and check one; if you want to get 4 free ounces of soda and a bag of peanuts; if you want 3 more inches of leg room; if you want witty banter from the flight attendants......fly Southwest.
BUT if cost is the most important item to you: pack light, bring a water bottle & fill it in the airport, brace yourself, and fly spirit!"
2012-07-24,Spirit Airlines,VSNrZjGm9wKzhguZFomRYA,2,Hello Spirit Airline. I'm sittin' in one of your planes now in Vegas headed to Oakland. It's already 45 minutes late because of some paperwork. Is this something I can get my money back for? Or I can sue you for.  The weather is lovely so it sure looks fine to fly. This wait is ridiculous. Please respond to mclato12@yahoo.com.
2012-08-05,Spirit Airlines,PaSH4pcnAqYoZcz7-diM3g,3,"I have been on this airline a few times and they are a budget deal. I got some great rates to Dominican Republic and one time to Guatemala. Two important things to remember   1) Many of their flights stop off in Miami for a layover. Most flights from Vegas (and possibly the west coast) have you arrive at like 7am in Miami or ft launderdale. I had two layovers there...each layover was 6+ hours. Not really worth it to me, even if I am saving $80.
2) They are cramped and charge you like $40 for luggage check.
I have heard they are late often but have always been on time for me. I mean, it seems like most airlines run late these days."
2012-08-06,Spirit Airlines,d4mwPew_42rmhmzFftgDKg,1,"Just pay the extra to fly a trustworthy airline. They are AWFUL. I am actually sitting in vegas after my 1st flight was delayed in Chicago and now I have at least 5 people here telling me 10 different things on why I have been sitting here for 5 hours. The customer service, well the supervisor laughed in my face when I asked questions like "" why is this flight delayed?"" you know, respectable questions that any person waiting for 5 hours might want to know. Don't fly with them."
2012-08-11,Spirit Airlines,uDkPF8eUO7_zedgyEHni-g,4,"Wow some of you are so mean!  So this is Spirit Airlines, where their slogan is ""hey we're a cheap airline"" not a ""hey we're super fancy and will give you free pretzels and prize ourselves on supreme utmost awesomeness.""

I enjoyed my spirit flight to DFW from LAS because I upgraded my seats, knew that I would be paying for my check-in baggage (we just took 1 huge one), and overall knew the experience I was getting into.  However, despite all that I still saved $430 from flying with any other airline.

What was especially cool was that there were 3 drunk people on my redeye flight back to vegas who were being super loud and annoying and cursing and they were kicked off the flight, way to go spirit!  

So if you choose Spirit a few tips:  1) UPGRADE YOUR SEATS!  Pay the additional fee to get one of the nicer seats, it makes a huge difference.  
2) Try to get all your stuff into one super big luggage.  
3) We took a backpack, and it was free, and that's where we kept our snacks or drinks (you are charged for them on the flight)
4) I had awesome stewards/stewardesses.

Just one downside, we were delayed on the way home, which kind of sucked, but the pilot made up the time in the air so that was awesome."
2012-08-12,Spirit Airlines,GXN5QnJHVlwNVo3SuOm2rA,3,"Spirit is OK. Like other reviewers have said, you need to prepare yourself for a flight, otherwise you WILL be caught by surprise by hidden fees. The key to this is reading their contract of carriage. Yes, it's like 900+ pages, but be aware of the fees and charges and you can indeed get a very cheap flight with them. 

I have flown back and forth a few times from Boston to Myrtle Beach for as little as $90 for my wife and myself. More typically, we do check a single bag, and end up paying around $160 or so RT for the two of us. 

We let the airline select our seat (it's an hour and a half flight, who cares?) and make sure to print boarding passes ahead of time. My wife and I have never not sat next to each other even with assigned seats. Double check your carry on items fit into the small personal item container. And you are OK. 

Yet, every single time I fly I see someone at the gate freaking out over a $40 checked bag fee. While I do feel bad that they were surprised by these costs, they aren't hidden. 

Finally; don't make any assumptions about what is free or not on Spirit Airlines. I wouldn't be surprised if they hooked up a mask to you to measure how much oxygen you use and charge for that. They key is research and making sure you are aware of what those fees are. 

Chances are, once you calculated it all out, you will still save a ton of money vs. flying another airline. It's just more of an aggravation to get there. 

Pros: Cheapest flights around, even after fees, if you plan for it. 
Cons: Requires hours of research to ensure you don't get charged extra for things; flights are often delayed or late."

I was trying to wheel my own carry on and under seat bag and asked the flight attendant if he would please help my mom get her rolling carry on over that big bump as you enter the plane. He looked at me, smiled and refused to help her. When we boarded the plane, one passenger said loudly ""These seats are disgusting"". I thought she was pretty rude, until I sat in the dirty seat with trash on the floors and in the seat pockets. The emergency instructions were torn in half.  A young German man, who obviously never flown a bargain airline, asked for a blanket and pillow and the flight attendant responded to his call with "" Already?""..( I think referring to the fact we had not lifted off yet). And told him to get out his back pack for a pillow and blanket. 
On the way back, the one carry on bag that I shared with my mom was ""overweight""- which was strange b/c the exact same stuff went in that bag the first time and was not over then. Another 25 dollar charge for that.  I am not sure how much money I saved, but had about 125 bucks in hidden fees, so next time it will be any other airline."

My grandmother passed away before I could use my airline ticket that I purchased to say my goodbyes. In an attempt to modify my ticket to fly out for the funeral, I encountered rude and unhelpful operators. Spirit Airlines policy is to charge the consumer a $125 fee to cancel a reservation and receive zero credit from the original plane ticket purchased. The other option is to pay $125 to modify the ticket to another date, which is slightly reasonable. What was not reasonable was telling a mourning grandchild that they must immediately pick a date to modify their trip for a funeral. When I was disappointed to hear that they had no grievance policy, I informed them that I would need to call back since I was unsure of the funeral dates. The operator's response was ""Just to let you know Ms. Perez, when you call back our policies will not change."" I work in a profession that allows our employees to do what is in the customer's best interest. I am truly disappointed and disgusted with Spirit Airlines. I encourage everyone I know to never fly this airline. It is not worth the money saved flying a discount airline. Going forward, we will always fly a more reputable airline no matter what the savings may be with Spirit."

I had lost my confirmation code on the return flight, and staff jumped right in and assisted me and arranged for both our seats together.

Showed up the recommended 2 hours prior to flight, and the spirit counter was completely unattended for a full hour while I sat there, getting more and more pissed off with each momet that passed. 

The baggage fees are mindblowingly outrageous. Absolute rape of the wallet. And misleading at that. I travel with an antique samsonite suitcase which is well within the baggage size limitations for carry on bags, but it was five or ten dollars cheaper to check it. Being a 24 year old, I still don't have a whole lot of money to throw around and the extra $80 to check a small piece of luggage is obscene.  After I recieved my bag, it was covered in what looked like residual sticker goo and dirt and a big 'ole scratch right down the middle. Great.

2012-11-12,Spirit Airlines,zt7mUY_NjbssH6zH_3yAaw,1,"If you're not booking directly through Spirit Airlines website, beware of their $50 carry-on baggage fee (each way/each bag). This hidden charge is not included in the price on Travelocity, Orbitz or Expedia websites, and will be sprung on you when you attempt to print your boarding pass at airport kiosk.

If you're a very light traveler, and can stuff your clothes & toiletries inside a small backpack or shoulder bag (small enough to fit under your seat) you can avoid Spirit's exorbitant carry-on baggage fees. 
And yes, they do charge for checked-in bags as well.

Lesson: If you're booking through Travelocity or Orbitz, make sure to add $100 baggage fees to Spirit 's deceptively low fare."
2012-11-15,Spirit Airlines,RBNo1Rs3oBvL1CTh8BHbAA,1,"Never again.  I used Travelocity to book a flight out to Vegas for a business trip.  This was the only flight with the times I needed so I booked it.  I didn't think it was all that great a deal either. And Travelocity didn't warn about all the fees you will incur when you do check in with Spirit (which I really think they should do since they aren't like other airlines). 

I'm pretty sure if you sneezed and asked for a tissue, a flight attendant would charge you for it.  I am a really anxious flier, so for me I need to sit in the window and see what's happening.  I checked in like I would with any flight to pick my seat, and if you want to actually choose your seat you pay at least $18 for it.  Otherwise you can let them assign you and maybe you won't be shoved in the middle.  I don't like this, no other airline does this.  It's a rip off.  Bags were also a few dollars more, and the weight limit is 10 lbs. less than every other airline.  Strike two.  Between picking a normal seat (nothing special...and don't expect leg room) and checking my bags it was about $100 extra.  What a rip off.  Oh, and if you want to carry-on instead of checking, you will pay about $100, so don't waste your money.  They will find a way to make you pay. They also destroyed my luggage, and this suitcase is pretty indestructible.

The leg room is non-existent, and you feel like you are riding a greyhound in the sky.  The plane seems like it is about to fall apart at any moment, and if you feel cramped in a regular airplane, this will make you feel claustrophobic.  The only awesome part was that they had drink deals.  One drink for $8 or two for $11.  Worth it to get two if you are flying a long distance. And they come around twice during the flight."

I was told at the counter, if I don't print out my own boarding pass I would be charged $2.00 extra per ticket.  My choice.  Some choice.   Also, it cost $45.00 to check each piece of luggage, $50.00 to carry it on.  Folks if you think your suitcase  is small think again.  Get out your measuring tape.   And, imagine  being asked to help with the cleanup at the end of a flight so Spirit can keep their prices down.

2012-12-02,Spirit Airlines,V_WM-aTVR2teKMUVs6WoKA,1,"Worst airline I have ever had to deal with in over 25 years of frequent flying. Booked a flight from Minneapolis to Fort Lauderdale fl. For my son.
Within a couple weeks he received a email that the flight had been canceled and was rebooked to a later flight that day. It was important to be in Fort Lauderdale right away in the morning so I looked online, and even though they sent us an email saying the flight was canceled, they were still booking passengers on the same flight.
 I called spirit and talked to ""Kevin"" who had such a thick Indian accent that it made it verry difficult to communicate. I explained that we needed a refund so we could take another airline or if in fact we could still take the original flight  (seeing they were still offering it online ) that would work too. I was VERY clear that it needed to be the exact original flight time and date. He set it up and again I asked him to clarify that it was the same flight and he said it was. 
Next on the date of the flight My son gets to the airport and there is not even a representative of the airline available, only a very small sign stating the flight was canceled. This is at 1:00 in the morning and he needed to be in Florida before noon that day. I was forced to get him a flight on another airline so he could get there on time. The next morning I called Spirit to find out what had happened and asked how to go about getting a refund for the first half of the round trip airfare. I had  to struggle  through another conversation with a rep (who again was very difficult to understand)  and was told that the trip was rebooked for the day before and we failed to show up for the flight and so forfeited any refund and also cancelled the return flight with no refund. I explained that no, I was very clear that it had to be booked for the same day and time as the original flight and the booking agent must have messed up and booked it for the wrong day. I was then informed that they record all calls and would review the conversations and would call us back within 48 hours. If it was their error they would help us but if they determined it was our error they could do nothing to help us. They never called back so we called them back 2 days later and were then told that there was no record of us ever calling them about the mix up. So here I am having to book another last minute return flight. So now...what was originally a great deal ended up costing several hundered  dollars more than planned and much stress and incovience. Terrible customer service and definitely not a good deal. Also....there were several other passengers who showed up at the airport for the same flight  that were never notified of the cancellation."
2012-12-05,Spirit Airlines,2D8W1YZFBJqQl9Jqv5btlg,1,"Avoid at all costs. The $30-$60 savings using Spirit over another airline is not worth the time you will spend in the airport, paying extra baggage fees and dealing with staff that don't care about how you get from A to B. 

Even writing the company an email telling them how they screwed up isn't fruitful. After they delayed my flight from LAS to LAX 3 hours (I COULD HAVE DRIVEN) they managed to send me a nice email that was basically saying, 'we don't give a shit, thanks for giving us your money.'

Customer service isn't in the Spirit Airlines vernacular. As a customer, you'll always be the last thing on their minds."

2. Terrible customer service. At one point, a flight attendant joked about the safety protocols - if we weren't listening, she wished us good luck if the plane crashed..
3. If you don't like leg space on the airplane, then this is your airline. But if you're like me and like some space, you won't like Spirit. I'm 5'1'' and even I barely had space to just sit normally. Ridiculous. 

Don't use Spirit. Pay the ""extra"" money to use another flight, and you'll break even with the additional fees Spirit tacks on. Spirit - I want to say a lot of profane things right now but am refraining.. this time. Never again."

I will never ride Spirit even if they pay for my flight as my time is more precious. This is the worst airline (or is it even?) I ever flew and I had been on 15+ including many budget airlines all across the world.

I was writing to explain mine and my friend's worst experience in brief, but it became an essay. So don't read below this paragraph unless you really want to. Just believe me and fly other airline, NOT Spirit.

Below are the experience I had... the worst.... I couldn't even believe

- I woke up 10 min before scheduled departure of my original flight and called spirit for another ticket on later flight that night, after explaining the situation. (100% my fault) Then found out that the flight was actually delayed for 1.5 hr. If they have told me that it was delayed, I probably have made the original flight since MGM is like 5 minutes from airport.

- The next flight at 10 PM that costed $110 was delayed for 1 hr then changed to 2 hr then 4 hr, making me arrive Oakland at 2:55 AM! Plane from Portland was sitting at the departing airport all the time, but I was not told at the counter, or the boarding pass and NOBODY was at the gate until then changing 2 hr delay to 4 hr.

- Things happen and I under stand that. But after check-in, settle in, etc, I will hardly get any sleep at my hotel that costed me almost $200 which was non-refundable, but I rather get some good sleep then continue the next day, so I kindly explained my situation to the attendant at the gate, asking maybe they will push me to next morning and provide me a room. She says things happens we can't control it. Your money is yours. Our is ours. Nope. I just shorten it down, but they were VERY RUDE. No apology at all. Non of this is their fault. At this point I just decided to sleep one more night on my money and move my ticket next morning.

- People were lining up at the gate already, so I thought I will go to the counter and talk to manager about this situation and get my ticket changed at the same time. After explaining about the situation and the rudeness of the staff and etc, not demanding a single thing, just expressing complaints about their service, AND even telling her that all this time non of the staff mentioned any word close to ""sorry"" or ""apologize"" and that's what made me mad and the service should be better and what I get is... the same line from the staff at the gate.. not a single apologize or even a slight expression of it.... 

-I give up now. I bet the CEO of Spirit will tell me the same thing. I ask the supervisor if she can change my ticket for tomorrow morning's flight and she ""points"" at the line with 30 people waiting. When I asked her really, she suggests me to pass security walk all the distance to the gate to ask the staff there.

- After talking to Spirit staff on the phone (to make things quicker I thought) for 20 mins and after further lightening my wallet further for taxi and hotel, I flew out about 1 hour after scheduled time the next morning. 

- My friend arrived and departed (or supposed to) with Spirit on same route. I get a  text from him before his arrival, 2 hours delay... I get a text from him upon his departure, 2 hrs delay... then flight canceled.... He had to stay over night, couldn't get on the morning flight with Spirit and finally flying back on Southwest at 7 PM.

- Due to my situation and my friend's, I had to check their LAS-OAK route schedule  for about 5 days and they have 2 flights a day. NOT A SINGLE ON TIME. They are all delayed for 40+ minutes and more than half of them like 2 hours or canceled.

I would never fly with Spirit. I would never fly with them even if they give me ticket for free. I would give it a thought if they pay me $500 and bagging them to fly them one more time. If I am alone. But I will refuse if this flight is for an important trip like a marriage. Save yourself. Sorry about the long review. I was just so frustrated.

UPDATE: After reading other reviews, I figured I did not say anything about the quality of their flight onboard. I am 5' 11"" and my legs were pinned at front seat (sorry for the front passenger). The plane was pretty old not in good shape, worse than a propeller plane that I had been on in US two years back. I haven't tried the restroom or other thing, but one thing I noticed while exiting the plane was that two staffs at the gate, and who always say ""thank you for flying with us"", were chatting themselves. At that point I figured, even the employees know it."

We booked our vacation package through Orbitz 3 months ahead. At that time,Spirit  Airline had the most fitted flight schedule,so we picked it. But we were notified the flight we booked was cancelled and we had to fly out the following morning. We were force to accept it&booked an additional night stay at Vdara. When we arrived at airport, they told us our normal size carry-on luggage cannot fit on the overhead bin. We had to pay $35.00 for each luggage both way!!! Then we tried to check in online for our returning flight the night before...our flight time changed to a night flight! We were shocked co'z we had to get back to work. So I called Spirit Air ... I was on the phone for more than an hour trying to get help. First the rep from overseas told me the flight had been cancelled. But i knew it wasn't true since i checked on flight  schedule online. Then they told me there was an error, our flight is overbooked& they can't do anything about it. How about that?!?! Then I called Orbitz,waited for 24mins before I get to speak to a person. Elise the rep was nice but not helpful. She 3 way called Spirit Airline but nothing can be done. So...we were forced to changed our plan twice. Second time without any notification at all. Don't ever fly with Spirit Airline!!!!"

Don't EVER fly with these folks unless you don't mind the extra stress, hassle, and ripped off sour taste in your mouth. 

Family went from Portland to Las Vegas over the holidays. Yes, our fault we didn't read every single fine print sentence -- we never knew an airline would THINK about charging for ... carry on baggage!! We paid over $ 200 just in these fees. They charge for water, for boarding passes. I'm still astounded, and WILL NEVER use this airline again.  They are not cheaper once you add on these fees.

I've never been in such a cheap feeling airplane, and less leg room than I've ever experienced. 

Please hope these folks go out of business."
2013-01-03,Spirit Airlines,NGglZ-SqaaeatzjxbYA-2w,1,Absolutely horrible experience! Flying Spirit air was an epic mistake that I will NEVER make again! I lost two full days on my trip to Jamaica because spirit did not have a crew for the airplane! We sat at the gate looking at an airplane with no captain or crew. The only smart ones at the terminal were the captain or crew for staying home and not wasting their time with spirit airlines. The flights at the gates on either side of us were actually canceled and the people had to find hotel rooms at 11:00pm. I had two flights to and from Jamaica and every single flight was delayed. NEVER AGAIN.
2013-01-04,Spirit Airlines,cwBArBvw6IQNS23wfBe1CQ,1,"I want to go and shower after dealing with these slime balls! The hidden baggage fees these jerks get away with are criminal. We've got 7 people flying....someone else booked the flights. They admitted they had not used Spirit before. They have apologized using Spirit. Spirit's website would not let me check my bags online from their site for some reason (because someone else in our party had checked themselves in which is the normal thing to do!! Spirits website automatically did the whole party as a check in their fore everyone else gets to pay the extra fees...which you dont' know that at the time 'til you call the creeps) Sooo....I had to call Spirit to get my bags checked in and pay upfront (which is supposed to save you $5 per bag). But, because I called Spirit charged me $5 extra. My wife and I both are checking 2 bags each for $160...because Spirit does not allow normal carry on /roll ons. I explained to their foreign phone operator that had their website allowed me to check in online my bags and myself like it's supposed to....I wouldn't be charged the extra charge....anyone defending these actions are stupid and/or probably work for this airline. This flight for us will cost us more than had we booked another airline. I can not say enough to express how used I feel having to fly with these crooks. Do yourself and everyone else a favor...DO NOT USE this airline and let this guys get away with their game plan they've got going. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! I will let any and all Spirit employees on my flight know my feelings and hopefully my venting to these airline peeps will at least let me feel better for being taken. A pox on these guys!!!"
2013-01-07,Spirit Airlines,5DbP-wXSCcazwy7-bMaexw,5,"Spirit Airlines is the best airline I've ever flown! I wish I could give it 10 stars! I'm not stupid, I'm not insane, I just know how to travel cheap, from point A to point B, and save a whole lot of money. I originally began flying Spirit in late 2011 from OAK-LAS and back several times a year. Ever since I began flying Spirit, I've had wonderful flights, all on time, never delayed or cancelled, I've had the kindest crew, and great comfort. 

DO NOT be fooled by other reviews where people say ""Don't fly Spirit; hidden fees"" where those users have only taken the airline once or twice, and have never read the fine print about what this airline does for it's customers. This airline does charge for both carry on and checked baggage, however Spirit allows you to put 1 small bag underneath the seat in front of you for free. Also, DO NOT try and sneak your bags through security thinking you'll get it on for free, they will charge you $100 at the gate-I've seen it, and I've seen people get rejected from boarding the flight because they didn't have $100 to pay the fee. Save yourself time and money by booking ahead of time. If you're smart, you may be in the $9 fare club like myself and gain instant access to discount bag fees and discount flights. It's one of the reasons I love this airline and why I fly so cheap. The most I ever paid for a roundtrip flight was $120 from Oakland to Las Vegas two days before the departure date. I didn't have any bags, I didn't select my seats, therefore, I paid the fare that I saw at the bottom. There are no hidden fees unless you're stupid to believe that being charged for baggage is a hidden fee. Also, they do charge for snacks (they give unlimited free refills for coffee and tea)-if you have a problem with that, fly for another airline. Spirit is meant to be a budget airline, and be thankful for flying!

Throughout 2012, and just in 2013, I've been taking Spirit back and forth between Las Vegas and Oakland. Spirit has provided the cheapest fares with at least $100 in savings compared to different airlines, or airports. My flights, which are sometimes purchased at the last minute, end up costing me anywhere from $27-$60. My most recent flight cost me $27 and was purchased 30 hours before my flight left. Be sure to keep an eye out for their fares as they sometimes rise or lower as the days go on. If you're traveling without bags, and you're not selecting your seat, THE PRICE YOU SEE IS THE PRICE YOU PAY. Once you're at the airport, you can choose any seats free of charge, unless it's a Big Front Seat-then you'll have to pay a fee. The BFS are EXACTLY like business class of any other airline-It's like American, Delta or Airtran for Example. It's a 2x2 seat configuration with a little more recline than economy, and more legroom. Trust me. I tend to book BFS because I'm over 6 feet, and like to spread out like everyone else. The seats are HEAVENLY! Especially the brand new airbuses that just came out with leather seats! Even the cramped up seats towards the back are nice-you just have to spend a few minutes adjusting and you'll be fine.

Spirit is a wonderful airline. I love flying with them, and always look at their fares before looking at other airlines. The crew is always a delight to be around, the flights always leave on time and tend to arrive a bit early. Despite their rules about charging for bags, or snacks, they're a great airline. Even Virgin Australia and Virgin America charges for snacks and checked baggage, so why complain? Just remember to read the fine print about bag and seat fees, book in advance and save money, and if you're tall like myself, get youself a good seat. This IS a budget airline. :)

It is now 3:00am and the workers have made it clear that the flight will likely not take off.  They offered us a refund of our baggage fees and our seat assignment fees (that's right, seat assignment fees), but the told us they could not refund our ticket prices.  The $750 for our 4 tickets would have to come from the third party site we booked through.  Really the worst!  I can't believe this is an American company.

Supposed to have the 12:30 redeye from Vegas to Dallas...flight has been postponed til 4 am- maybe.  Looks like they are canceling it all together due to mechanical issues.  I came into this with eyes wide open thanks to yelp (after tickets were booked) we packed our cases perfectly paid the cheapest fee we could to check the bags.  The man checking us in was nice but freely and laughingly  admitted that they don't care how many reviews get posted, etc.  ""get it all out"" were his words. (We were being nice, just asked if a lot of people get upset about the bags, etc.)  Anyway, we were prepared to deal.  Love you, Heath!!! Good seein' you tonight.  :) love the glasses.We joked about the small space we knew we'd be crammed into, we bought snacks ahead of time, we played games when it was delayed.  But not getting us there at all is unacceptable...and from the reviews this is typical for spirit.  A cheap airline is one thing...but all of these problems - too much.  This place needs to change their ways or shut down so they quit messing up people's travel plans! To those few positive reviews...after what I've read, heard from other friends, and now seen in person, I'm convinced that you are either very, very, very lucky or (and more likely) you are the spirit executives!

How anyone could possibly rate this airlines above one star is an absolute falsification of information. This is the worst experience I've ever had traveling. 2 hour delay going, 1.5 hour delaying coming. Combine that with bag charges of $150. 

Originally my ticket from Oakland to Las Vegas was $149 roughly $20 cheaper then southwest. Bag charges brought my ticket to just below 300. The delays caused me to have to pay for an extra day of parking as well."

If you are looking for a cheap flight to go on vacation you should be looking somewhere else. The bag fees will eat up any money you could've saved. However, if you are just traveling with a backpack or small suitcase those fees do not apply and the price of the flight is as cheap as it gets. Just make sure you know what you are getting into before you fly. It isn't like they try to disguise the fees as they are clearly marked when you purchase tickets."
2013-01-22,Spirit Airlines,eZnDsGSR1rFcbYEbr_XRKg,1,"The worst of the worst. Have you ever seen the southwest commercials and wonder who they are talking about? Well the answer is Spirit. The price may seem great at first but when you factor in all the hidden charges, its not worth it. I took a short 2 day trip from San Diego to Las Vegas. My girlfriend and I packed one bag in order to save money. Roundtrip cost $80. Then if we want to sit next to each other in the rear of the plane $5 per passenger, per flight. Next our flight leaving SD was delayed and hr. Great start to the trip. 

So Vegas was fun. My girlfriend won $. Hooray!!!

Now back to Spirit. Too bad Iron Maiden took the title of their airplane Flight 666. Otherwise, I would give it Spirit
Returning to SD the flight was cancelled, 1 hr line to talk to some idiot woman who did absolutely nothing for me. So instead I rented and car and drove 5 hrs through the dessert. I've had some horrible experiences with airlines but this was by far the worst airline i've ever flown.

2013-02-18,Spirit Airlines,wygQU7J6-gFHqKuo399ffw,1,"There really is not much to say that hasn't been said already, but I will write my story/review anyway...

I flew Spirit a year ago to Ft. Lauderdale and had no problems, issues, or delays. This time, we flew to Vegas from O'hare Wed-Sat and it was a completely different situation. I knew about the luggage cost, so the additional $150 I had to pay for my boyfriend and I was something I was ""okay"" with. I paid on-line the night before because it's a bit cheaper that way. For carry-on, I paid $40 each way for his bag, and for my check-in luggage, I paid $35 each way. 

We arrived to O'hare on Wednesday 2/13, with clear, blue skies in Chicago and obviously in Vegas, however, there was a two hour delay. So instead of leaving at 9:09 am, we ended up departing at 10:51 am. When we asked the extremely rude lady at the counter for the reason, all we got in response was an idiotic look and a ""whhaaaaatttt?"" At this point, my boyfriend was going crazy, but I was still ""okay"" with the situation because I've heard A LOT worse, and read A LOT worse. 

Fast forward three days later... we arrive to the Vegas airport about 1.5 hours before our scheduled departure at 5:20 pm. We go through check-in and all that, get to our gate, and it says 5:54 pm. Ok.. fine... we can handle 30 minutes. I step out to get a drink, and my boyfriend calls me to tell me that it just got pushed to 8pm!!!!!!!!!!!! I get back to the gate, and they announce that the plane has a maintenance issue and is currently in San Diego. Not sure how much more time passes by, but we get another announcement that the plane is now delayed until 9:30 pm and that there is something wrong with the plane and is getting a part replaced in San Diego. WOW... 

At this point, they called everyone up to receive a voucher. I got in line thinking it may be a voucher for a free flight or something (HA!), though my boyfriend was against getting anything from them, and we ended up getting a voucher for a meal in the airport for $7 per person... are you freaking kidding me?! We ended up using it and it was not even enough to cover two pretzels and two drinks... thanks a lot Spirit!!! It's more like a joke than anything... 

At one point in our short stay at the airport, I walked by the screen, and saw that the departure now says 10:04 pm... these bastards didn't even announce anything until 15 minutes after I saw the time on the screen. There was nothing anyone could do but wait... and that's what we all did. 

NEVER AGAIN am I going to fly through Spirit... I don't know how the hell this company is still in business or operating. I highly doubt that they were fixing the plane... they just don't have enough of them and what is a 5 hour delay to their passengers?!?! The staff is beyond rude.. I feel like that's a requirement when they apply for this job. I had a great trip, but this totally ruined everything and I am still recovering from exhaustion!!!"
2013-02-18,Spirit Airlines,eqLgfkbTyyV7CmXIFUX_mg,3,"I have never used ""ghetto"" in any of my past reviews, but I was quite sure I would be plastering all over this one.

We were originally booked on another airline, but due to a mechanical failure our flight was either going to be delayed several hours or cancelled. These things happen and I really wont hold against that red tailed airline, as I would rather arrive safe than not at all.

It was the last flight of the night and we just wanted to get home and our options were limited. The customer service agent then suggested we head over to the Spirit counter.

No, really.

I've heard all the horror stories how this airline charges for everything from carry on baggage to peanuts. But it was literally the only option. 

Amazingly there was no line at the ticket counter. I told the customer service rep the deal and in turn he gave me the low down. He did an excellent job explaining each and every additional charge and broke everything down right down to the amount they charge for fuel (pretty much all airlines charge for fuel, you just didn't know that). My last question before committing. 

""hey, leg room is essential can we book aisle seats?""

Unfortunately all the aisles were already taken, but the agent then told us for an additional $75 we could book what they call the ""Big Seat"".

What the hay, we want to get home and even though the flight would take us to Oakland and not SFO it was worth the risk and maybe might even score a Yelp review out of it.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by said ""Big Seat"". It was pretty much like any other domestic Business Class seat on most any other airline, minus the pitch. The airplane itself was new and not at all smelly like I had expected. The service in the air was again good but not great then again it was only an hour plus flight. The overhead compartments were large enough to easily fit our carryons.

You probably wont find me switching my allegiance to Spirit. But I must say this, for what they advertise they are. That is exactly what you get.

We got Spirit yes we do!"
2013-02-19,Spirit Airlines,wavVDgvKpjX09lCXoBxGLQ,1,"If you like spending time at airports this is the airline for you! Flight to Vegas was delayed by an hour, then we were boarded and had to disembark due to mechanical issues, the airline did not have a mechanic available so they had to fly one into Oakland from las Vegas, the mechanic missed his flight and eventually they used a mechanic in Oakland (a union issue perhaps?). A 12:50 flight delayed until 5:30. 
When we finally got on the plane again and were able to leave, it was possibly the most cramped I have ever been on a plane.  I am 5'11"" and I was just barely wedged in.
My return flight was cancelled, without another flight to rebook until 18 hours later.  I had to wait in line for 90 minutes to get a voucher for a hotel that night, and by the time I got it the shuttle was no longer running, so I had to pay for a cab.  
I was given a $150 voucher for purchase of future flights, which of course will never be used."

This last trip from Oakland to Vegas was no problem - all went well - problem was on the flight home. I arrived on time for the flight waiting at the gate - and 45 before the flight we are told to move to another gate - no worries - hoofed it over to next gate - arrive at new departure gate and we are told our plane is being taken over by  flight to Chicago - WTF why?. Our flight was delayed over an hour - what made matters worse is that attendant at he desk near the gate never really told a lot of the folks expecting to go to Oakland on time that their was delay and the announcements over the loud speakers kept telling us we were still on time for Oakland - guess what a lot of people for Oakland start trying to board the Chicago flight - not good. Finally get on the right flight - arrived to my seat which I paid more for and found that someone had broken an ink pen and smeared ink all over the seat - did not look like the seat had been cleaned - I was not offered another seat - I had to scrounge around and find something to place over the seat so I could sit down and not ruin my pants - never again Spirit - dirty planes, delays all the time from what I heard from other passengers."

After setting up an acct which they promise only takes a minute, and attempting this too too many times, I was not able to complete my transaction and was eventually blocked, flight closed. Upon arriving to the airport and deciding to deal with a human instead of the computer, the nice rep told me I'd have to check in at the kiosk or she'd have to charge me to check in at the counter. The worst! Now my flight has been delayed for a second time today.  This has been my first and last experience with this raggedy penny pinching money hungrier than the rest airline. They don't seem to care a bit, only about the bottom line which leads me to question whether they've gone the cheap route and refurbished airplanes maybe others have passed up.

2013-03-11,Spirit Airlines,SHsiMLPK1xBfy10bK3XWuQ,2,"As one yelper put  it ""this is the greyhound of the skies"". I would agree.  Maybe even through walmart of the skies in there.

Bottom line, if you don't mind:
1.)  non existent customer service
2.)  EXTREMELY cramped seating ( I am 5'4 and my knees were touching the back of the chair in front of me with my seat all the way up.  My husband who is 6'0 was seriously uncomfortable
3.) Being nickeled and dimed at every turn (you have to PAY for carry on baggage and water on the plane)
4.) Dirty planes (bathroom smelled like an outhouse - seriously)
5.) Chairs were ripped and I couldnt use my tray table because it was broken and wrapped shut in duct tape (kid you not - i posted a photo).
6.) Late departure for no assorted made up reasons (once it was a late flight crew, the other time they said ti was due to weather....seriously? the plane we were waiting on was coming from Portland to Las Vegas and there were no storms. I think they just say this because they are short planes and they dont mind passing the wait time on to passengers.  There were two other spirit flights that were saying the same thing in the airport around us.
7.) Flight attends arguing about a cleaning crew not coming to do their job loudly in front of everyone
9.) Having to pay to select your seat or risk being seated away from your traveling companions..........

then this might be the airline for you.

I could give you the nitty gritty details regarding everything above but trust me, it has been said before. I have never flown on Spirit and was in a pinch so I had to go with them but I will never fly with them again.  They are almost as bad as United Airlines.

Alaska or Southwest for me next time.

If you dont have the money to fly anything else than maybe go with spirit but just know you are really only saving a few dollars after paying for baggage, choosing your seat etc."
2013-03-18,Spirit Airlines,wNp9yqjemRtwCTCmnWT4_w,1,"The main reason that I left a 1 star (I'd leave 0 if I can) were the charges. Spirit Airlines charges you for anything and everything every step of the way. Here's a brief overview of their charges:
- Charge to sit next to each other ($5-$15)
- Charge to CARRY-ON luggage ($35-$45)
- Charge to CARRY-ON luggage if you didn't pay before security: $100
- Charge to CHECK-IN luggage ($35-$45)
- Charge for water/drinks/beverages ($3-$7)
- Get this. Charge for PRINTING YOUR TICKET AT THE CHECK IN DESK ($5)

I am a little miffed about the last one. No airline charges for that. On the trip over to Vegas we made a mistake by not paying for our luggage ahead of time, so it was $45 to check in. To fly back to Oakland we paid for it online ($35 for checked luggage since we paid ahead of time) but we didn't have a printer so we didn't print out our boarding pass. So figures you can just print it at the kiosk or the check in desk when you drop off your luggage right? My partner lined up to go drop off the luggage for check in and asked to print the ticket while at the front. The representative for Spirit said it'll be a $5 to print at the desk whereas it's FREE at the kiosk. Basically, she wasted not only OUR time but the time of the people waiting behind us in line, by basically refusing to service us unless we have a boarding pass. It would've taken less time for her to just print it out for us. We had to get out of line, print boarding pass at kiosk, and then get back in line. 
Very nonsensical.

Also the airplane itself is very old. Much much older than Southwest. The seats were worn out and it's very obviously so. They constantly disrupt the flight in making announcements for people to get a Mastercard membership with them to get a free ticket, or some promotional program or something. Very annoying and loud. Nothing you'd hear in Southwest.

Horrible experience, never going with Spirit again. We definitely paid more by going on Spirit and had much more unsatisfactory experience. Should've just paid a bit more upfront for Southwest!! Then we could have sat together too (for free!!)

- - - - -

Another Sad Story of how Horrible it is:
My partner and I were going to the gate at Oakland to board the plane to Vegas. On our way in, we saw a guy trying to fit his luggage into the ""Free"" slot at the gate. He managed to fit it in, but it was a little over the edge (maybe an inch above). The Spirit airline representatives were very stubborn and very un-sympathetic. They said it doesn't fit all the way in. Since it didn't fit all the way in, it was $100 to carry on the plane if you pay at the gate. My partner and I went through the gate, and didn't hear the rest of the conversation. Turns out 10 minutes later, that guy was actually seated behind me. What happened was, he ended up taking all of his clothing out of his suitcase and just stuffed it in a bag, and brought it on the plane. He ditched his suitcase because it was ridiculous to pay $100 to carry it on. Yet there were plenty of empty luggage compartments above us throughout the plane. Why did that 1 inch matter? The service representatives at spirit are ruthless!!

Lesson here? Be careful when you're flying Spirit (try not to even fly it at all). Make sure to measure your bags. Seriously."

I informed her this was our first time flying with spirits so I went ahead and paid for extra bags to be safe. Debra was so nice and helpful about the entire situation and even told me I paid for too many bags and refunded the bags I shouldn't have paid for !!!! This was the best service I have ever received at an airline and I have flown jet blue several times, southwest, air trans and delta. 
Our great experience continued aboard the flight. Our flight attendants Dustin and Jesue were hilarious and provided great service the entire flight!!!! 
The flight back the attendants were not as good as the first flight but still was good. 
I am writing this review because I have only read bad reviews about this airline and this was not the case for me, so I feel it's only fair to give credit were it is due! 
Thank you spirit airline for a great experience. 
I know a lot of ppl complain about the fees but the tickets are so cheap how can you complain?"
2013-03-21,Spirit Airlines,oAWMef0lty1koV41g6-M5w,1,"Flight delayed both ways, with no reason given. Poor customer service. Nickled and dimed for EVERYTHING: $25 for a carry-on bag, $5-$50 extra to actually get a seat with your travelling companion, $3 for an in-flight beverage (I'm talking soda here, not alcohol) etc. etc.  And literally, the most crammed, jam-packed seating arrangement possible for an aircraft: you get about 8 inches between your face and the seat in front of you. You could not PAY me to fly this airline ever again. EVER."

2013-03-21,Spirit Airlines,HMsuut9xqslt5h8XHRx58g,1,"This was the worst airline ever!!!!
I should have known when I booked my flight what I was getting into.. they charged me twice! There was no apology or empathy for the over draft charge in my bank account that accumulated due to there mistakes either. And when I told them to cancel them both I was told it would be a $100 few! Are you kidding me?!!  So there I was stuck..
My plane was delayed each way by 3-4 hours. 
Now I had heard the seating was a little cramped but I am only 5'3 so  i didn't think anything about it.. boy I was surprised when my legs where hitting the back of the seat in front of me!!! My legs where cramping from the lose of blood flow!  I couldn't help but feel sorry for the man in the window seat who was 6' ! 
The seats where torn and the airplane smelt like the bathroom which all most made me loose my lunch! When I went to the bath room I got to see why.  I've seen and smelt better portapotties  in 100 degree weather!
Not only do they charge you for any baggage.but water too and you better bring your credit card  since they don't take cash (what the hell? Cash is king!) $3 for a can of soda!
I for one will never take Spirit again! It worth the extra money to take another airline!"
2013-03-25,Spirit Airlines,xRAetXA5-KFi2dRaAxtLJg,1,"Since I can't rate 0 stars for Spirit Air, i'll be generous and give them 1 star. 

Wow, someone already said it - ""riding Spirit Air is like riding on an old beat-up greyhound bus"".  This is probably as ghetto as an airline can get. Yes, it lists the cheapest flight prices on the internet, but they'll get you on: seat assignments, (+$5 to $25), printing your boarding pass at the counter (+$5), baggage fees (+$25), and if your carry on luggage has wheels (+$25). I'm thinking that this is their business model - charge the lowest fares, but don't tell the customer about the additional MANDATORY CHARGES, until they commit to the fare. This is EXTREMELY SHADY!!! I have a feeling that that this airline will not last long. If they told you about all these charges up front, then guess what? It's no longer the cheapest fare on the internet! 

They pretty much ruined my vacation plans last week. I had a 4-day weekend and decided to go to the SF Bay Area. Flight was scheduled for 11:00am. When I got to the airport, they announced that the flight would be delayed for 5 HOURS!!! What the @%$#??? So now I end up missing a couple of important events. When we finally boarded the plane, it looked like they manage to jam a few more rows of seats into the plane, (it looks like they removed at least 6"" of legroom from each row). I felt sorry for the young lady sitting next to me - she was almost 6 feet tall and couldn't even straighten her legs. Heck, i'm only 5'8 and the legroom was too cramped for me!

I think I heard an announcement that they don't use cleaning crews for the plane, and this is how they pass the [false] savings on to you. Right. The plane was filthy and disgusting. Bring your own hand sanitizer, as you don't know what kind of exotic bacterias you can pick up as a result of touching something in the cabin (think flesh-eating bacteria). If the interior of the plane is this bad, I shudder to think how well the engines and safety mechanisms are maintained. It's only a matter of time...

Ok, so Sunday rolls around and it's time for me to fly back home. I rush to the airport to make my 1:15pm flight. I get there and what's this? The flight is delayed 3 HOURS!!! ARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!!!! This is unreal - are these people not concerned with their reputation? What kind of amateurs are running this airline? It is probably a short-term venture capital operation. My prediction: they won't be around in a couple of years, or will be bought out by another airline. 

Bottom line - save your money and your frustrations. Book any other airline but Spirit. Thousands of dissatisfied Spirit Airlines customers can't be wrong.

p.s. I have a feeling that most of the good reviews posted for Spirit Airlines are shills."

We went back and the Next  flight wasn't until the next night leaving us stranded in BWI over night. We caught a earlier flight with another airline as we needed to be in vegas on time for a government meeting the following morning. We already payed and booked a return flight home with spirit along with another $160 in baggage too.  When time came around to return on home on our scheduled flight. Spirit canceled our flight took all of our money and baggage fee's and wouldn't allow us on the flight. They sayed that if we didn't fly to vegas with them then they automatically cancel our return. We flew in another airline cause there craft wasn't until the last flight the following night n we need to be there in the morning: they wouldn't reinstate our flight reservations even though we payed for 2 airline seat tickets and baggage on the return flight. Would not give us a refund, comp, discount, or Anything. Told us to call there customer service # all to be hung up on by the Manager after a 30min call wait. Try to call back and the remainder of times just placed on hold or hung up on after 30min hold wait. Total amount lost and pocketed by Spirit airlines is $497.86 for the plane tickets and another $150 in baggage fee's we didn't use because the canceled our flight. Worst airline ever.

The whole plan was full of angry customers because they made EVERYONE pay $45/bag for anything with wheels. The so-called supervisor ""Angela"" at McCarran international airport for the airline stated ""this is policy of Spirit"" to charge $45 for a carry-on bag. YES Angela it is their policy to rob people blind with all these hidden fees. I'm surprised they did not charge for me to breath.

We would have already reached Los Angeles before 4pm even if we travel by car.

If you had to check at the airport it would be $100 and if you did it well ahead of time it would be $35.  Not only that, but paying the fee did not cover the entire trip, just the first leg.  Once those costs were factored in, this easily became more expensive than the other flights I had seen.

2013-06-11,Spirit Airlines,bHmxjickYE379COdHfPs9Q,1,"Let me put this disclaimer out there first, this was MY experience. Whether or not someone else had a smashing good time, or a horrid one, I cant speak for them. Only myself, and my fiance. We booked Spirit for Philly to Las Vegas for a quick get away. Yes, the tickets up front were cheaper, but after PAYING to check a bag online both ways, PAYING because it was 8 lbs over weight (yes, I understand now that I should've weighed before reaching the counter, bc the lady simply took our bag, set it to the side and said we owed $25. Her African accent was a little thick, so I couldn't quite get what she was saying. Anxious to get past TSA, my fiance just coughed up the money). After finally getting upstairs to find out our flight was delayed by 3 hours, I was done! Before I had set foot on the plane! We waited the 3 hours, then finally boarded our flight which was said to be late in from Dallas. I heard a stewardess mention the Philadelphia weather had a lot of flights delayed, however, Delta and United Air both had legs to LV, and they were leaving on time. In boarding I felt a bit better that I'd PAID to ensure my fiance and I sat together. But essentially people just moved to wherever they were comfortable after take off anyway...so I felt that expense was un necessary. 

Coming back, I was smart enough to drop the 8 lb overage. We get past TSA, and guess what? Our 10:40 is now leaving at 11:13. I could deal with that. There were mobs of people at the gate going in different directions with Spirit Airlines. Something told me to check my flight info online again, not only did it say new ETD 12:57 am, but it wasnt being reflected anywhere until 20 mins later when ppl became agitated. We  didnt board until 1:15 am. The stewardess mentioned that when one leg gets backed up it can effect the entire day. Im not a rocket scientist, but is it that hard to let passengers know as soon as possible that their flight is delayed??? If a 10:30 am flight has an impact on my 10:40 pm flight, I dont care if its 15 minutes, I'd like to know!!!  Between the jet lag and fatigue, I guess maybe a display from spirit air that they gave a crap would've helped. But I will not be flying Spirit ever again, unless we experience a war on US soil, and they are the only escape vehicle. Even then, I would be apprehensive.

  If you are not a college student, and you can place value on common courtesy and customer service, 

DO NOT FLY SPIRIT AIR. PLEASE PAY ANY OTHER AIRLINE TO GET YOU WHERE YOU ARE GOING. 

Trust me, you will come out ahead in exchange for the small ""frills"" you think you dont need (like notification that your flight is delayed as soon as SPIRIT knows, customer service in a recognizable form, and a glass of water on a 4 hour ride after waiting for a delayed flight for 3 hours)."

First I weighed my bags at home to make sure they were the required weight, and hell I even measured them.  I pre-paid them on the internet and my bags went smoothly thru checkout.  I flew from Vegas to Dallas round trip on the redeye and the plane was on time and they did not loose my bags.  Yes the seats are a little cramped, but I am 6ft and 205 and still was able to slide them under the seats in the front of me a bit for the two hour trip, my observation is 75% of the passengers are overweight, so what do you expect.  My trip back to Vegas was fine too..the plane was about 45 minutes delayed in leaving, but otherwise then that everything went fine.  Folks your flying no frills, A to B airline, read the website, follow the procedures and you should be fine.  Now I know they have planes that break down and are delayed etc... which they need to work on, but my personal trip was fine.

2013-06-15,Spirit Airlines,WrEhNE1wOkXUfXZdy-l5gA,2,"God help you if you're reading this review after you've booked a Spirit Airlines flight. If by some stroke of luck you're reading this before you buy, heed my warning: CLOSE OUT OF THE BROWSER NOW.

Ladies and gentleman, this for me was a lesson on the old adage: ""You get what you pay for.""

While I was stuck on the tarmac in Vegas, probably 100 yards away from my gate for 30 minutes after a 90 minute delay, I read reviews about how Spirit Airlines was the Greyhound of airline companies. 

This is an accurate representation of the flight. Everything seems old, I honestly thought the plane was going to fall apart a couple of times on the round trip. The seating is cramped, and you will be charged for anything under the sun.  Baggage claim was very annoying.

That amazing price is not so amazing after you add 70 bucks of baggage fees each way, plus 10 bucks to choose your seat (each way). Also don't bother choosing your seat. It really makes no difference, you are going to get screwed no matter what.

I told myself that If I won 600 bucks in Vegas I was going to just book a new one way ticket via any other airline back to Houston because I didn't want to experience Spirit Airlines a second time around.

At this moment, I'd give spirit 1 star because it was so bad.  Luckily they recovered for the return trip. Things went on without a hitch, kind of... There was still a delay, but it wasn't that horrible - typical really of any airline. I did feel like the plane was about to fall apart on take off and landing, but I guess I survived to tell the tale. Fine, you get 2 stars Spirit Airlines.

Bottom line: Make your trip to Vegas a fun one. Don't book Spirit becuase you end up spending the money you saved on baggage fees anyway. You'll also be annoyed with about 70% of the flight for various reasons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was the worst service and airline that I have ever experienced in all my history of flying. I asked the stewardess at one point (jokingly) when she inquired what I will have ""Anything free that you are offering"" and she just laughed out loud and said ""nice one"" and kept on laughing.  They lack things like a free drink, a free carry on, reclining seats, and more.

The carry on luggage rule is just highway robbery, especially when they tell you ""should have paid online, and would have saved you $10!"".  My bag fit into the 'free' box that Spirit provides, but yet the lady told me it wasn't a ""personal item"" (wtf's that mean!? a gym bag is? but a small compact carry on roller bag is not?). So that was ~$45 bucks (35 online as I'm told!?)

Seats DON'T recline, had to sit upright the whole flight (which doesn't sound as bad until you actually do it. I've honestly never flown upright now that I think about it, I've always reclined a little for reading and just general comfort on a 3+ hour flight).

There really isn't any cost saving going with Spirit, you will get raped for about $100 overhead for any carry on (both ways combined). You will arrive crabby and miserable."

They offer $50 for your next flight but they make you do it in 90 days. Ummm $50 for another horrible experience. No thank you. Please do not fly with this company.

My experience is like thousands of others and I would ignore the few who act like travel experts with the whole you get what you pay for...they apparently have no reasonable standards.  I mean you are flying which should be a little different than taking a bus.

- I am not sure how this airline hires, schedules, etc. but the only employees who seem to have any customer service skills are the pilots. The flight attendants in particular are uninterested thus not helpful.  examples include their dress/appearance, facial expressions, not knowing if plane is full or not, not guiding passengers, inappropriate conversations in front of passengers, etc.  
-The seating is cramped for the average adult...obese or not...photos of this are helpful.  I would suggest losing the metal bar across the ""magazine pocket"".
-They charge for everything which makes overall value questionable bench marked against other airlines.  They also miss opportunities to make money by not stocking liquor appropriately.  How do you run out of half the liquor you supposedly carry and you have only taken orders from front of plane to the exit row?
-Delays for hours with no believable reasoning.
-We were stuck on tarmac last night/this morning coming back to LV from DFW for an hour plus and then could hardly get past two Spirit gates deplaning as aisles were full of passengers waiting for more delayed outbound flights. Oh, forgot to mention baggage took another half an hour during which time people were trying to figure out what carousel bags would come in on.  The baggage office attendant told one passenger well Spirit bags come out on 10, 11, 12, etc..providing no other help than the simple Spirit sign with an arrow at entrance to the one side of baggage claim.

While I belong to their ""club"" which supposedly provides some value don't know how much I will use it as I will try to avoid flying this airline in the future."
2013-06-27,Spirit Airlines,ZEHlkWdpElTl2rnMj8Q9lg,4,The reviews on here are kind of unfair because it states all the extra fees and so forth when you book. Nobody can compete with their pricing and they are a true low cost carrier that can get you from point A to point B at amazing prices. You can go somewhere in a taxi or in a limo but you will pay for it but quite honestly the drop off from Spirit to any other coach seat for any airlines is marginal at best. The only reason i didn't give a 5 star rating is their flights are delayed fairly often because of small fleet of planes.

I could go on and on about the atrocity that is called ""Spirit"" (even the flight attendant encouraged us to write a complaint) but honestly, just thinking about ""the whole"" of the experience exhausts my mental capacity to recap the compiled horrors.

- Our flight was oversold & didn't bother to tell us until after our 4 hour delay.

Service was terrible, it's the detention room of highschool. The Walmart of stores. The greyhound. The motel of hotel services. or shall I say shack.. The turbulence went on for a straight hour and my flight was delayed for 7 hours, the connecting flight after that was delayed for 3 hours. Staff didn't inform me of this. 

I'll tell you this now, it is no ride in the park when you are 5'9. It's still a mystery to me how some people are giving this airline 4 & 5 out of 5 stars, maybe they hired workers to give good reviews so it can outweigh the bad ones. Or out of pure sympathy. AND to make matters worse, my luggages got lost. I guess they call it ""spirit"" for a reason, because the airlines bad ""spirit"" lingers on with you even after getting off the flight.

You get what you pay for, yes, but if you value your back and luggages save the cash for a better airline. Terrible experience."

2013-07-09,Spirit Airlines,J4xJCnXad_KUpQN8UbyynA,1,"There are not enough black holes (you know, those things that suck in stars?) in the universe to rate this insanely bad airline.

Oh, would that I have read these other reviews before I subjected myself to their excessive fees, lousy customer service, long lines, long waits, ancient airplanes, nickel-and-diming ($3 for water? Really?), and complete lack of anything resembling leg room.

Add to that the 45-minute wait for my single 20# bag (that cost me $70 to check - since it would have cost me $80 to carry on) - and the little tirade from the check-in counter girl about how we are ""privileged"" to fly with Spirit (she might just want to look that word up. I think she got it crossed with the word ""screwed"").

I cannot say this strong enough: AVOID SPIRIT AIRLINES AT ALL COSTS. 2,500+ complaints to the BBB can't be a good sign. Sure, they are all ""closed"" (which, I'm sure, has nothing to do with the fact that a business has to PAY to be listed with the BBB), but - hello? How many more before this stinkpit of an airline goes out of business, and deservedly so?

Hopefully soon.

By the way, after  you pay all their fees, you actually would have paid less to fly a real airline like Southwest or Alaskan. Just sayin'."
2013-07-27,Spirit Airlines,QJXwQENq61G0JV-4CE6RYA,1,"I had an awful experience with this airline, and DO NOT recommend. Our one hour flight was over 3 hours late because of the company's incompetence (the flight crew schedule caused the problems). What made this particularly awful is I received no text or email about the flight being delayed, even though at the airport they told us that they had known since 5am that there would be a delay. I talked to other people on our flight, and no one got an alert. They did absolutely nothing to right this wrong. Supposedly, we were going to get a 50$ credit that expires in 60 days, but this is worthless to me as I will never fly with them again. To top it off, they never even mentioned on the flight that we would get a credit, and I never heard about it again. Every other person I talked to on my flight said the same thing, they will never fly with Spirit because of the awful customer service and incompetence (late flights and canceled flights appear to be a regular occurrence). The supervisor I spoke to in Vegas was not accommodating or apologetic about this inconvenience. The bag policy is also absurd: you have to pay for your overhead carry on, and once you pay online for a bag you cannot get your money back if you decide you will not be taking a bag, only more worthless credits offered. Budget airline is not an excuse to be unprofessional, incompetent, and money grubbing. Good luck staying in business with such unhappy customers."
2013-07-29,Spirit Airlines,pa9ltuv7dfFABxmVP9TBZg,1,"I would give less than one if possible.  

I know their business model does not focus on getting repeat customers - they want to pull in the ""once a year fliers""; don't worry, I will never fly Spirit again.  I would not even accept a free flight on one of their planes. (Even with a free flight, you still might have to pay their check in bags fee, their fee to carry on bags, their fee to pick a seat, their fee for a soda, their fee because your bag is over 40 pounds, their fee because you didn't pay the fee earlier, their fee for joining the nine dollar fare club)  From now on, I will pay the extra $200 fee and fly United.

My Spirit flight from Las Vegas to Chicago landed 11 hours late because Spirit did not have enough ground crew to load the check  in bags onto the plane in Las Vegas, so the flight left an hour late.  I missed my connection in Dallas, and had to be rerouted through South Carolina.  

I had things to do in Chicago, including Book of Moron tickets and I missed that play because of Spirit.  The ""manager"" in Dallas - a bald headed guy in his forties made me feel like it was my fault the plane was late.  He showed no empathy, and his attitude was like ""this is what you get when you fly ultra low cost carriers"".  I thought he was a total prick, but then again he has a shitty job, working for a shitty airline.  In fact, most of the spirit staff I interacted with had that approach.

On the return flight from Chicago to Las Vegas Spirit again did not have enough ground crew to unload check in bags off the plane, so I never even got our check in bags.  The bags arrived at my house three days later in a delivery shipment.

The reason Spirit can't get anything right in Las Vegas is that they have basically a rush of  planes from all over the U.S. land at the same late night time (starting around 11:00 pm), and then they are supposed to turn around all the planes and have them leave between 30 and 45 minutes later.  They don't have enough ground staff to handle the number of planes coming and going, so like a freeway at rush hour... it all turns into gridlock."

SHORT STORY:  DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THIS AIRLINE!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!

LONG STORY:
I am currently delayed at the airport for the second flight of my round trip ticket because of this horrible airline. After my first flight the crappy service, lack of urgency, hours delayed, extremely dirty plane, and unprofessional staff I was ready to spend an extra 400$ to book a ticket back on a different airline just so I didn't have to do the return flight. I decided to give it one more chance and now here I am delayed for 2 hours so far (edit: TURNED OUT TO BE A 4 HOUR DELAY) kicking myself for thinking this company would actually do what it's supposed to do correctly.  I will NEVER fly this airline again. I wish I could create a pop-up window on their website that warns people not to put them through this hell. By the time I got on the plane for my first flight after experiencing such awful service/dirty interior, I was so scared that the quality of the plane and pilots would match the quality of service. I was literally scared for my life. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS AIRLINE!! You WILL REGRET IT!!!"
2013-08-02,Spirit Airlines,-PiLmkNWRAqMey8X8vBnSw,1,"Spirit is the worse airline you can go threw to fly anywhere. Going back and forth to Vegas often which is only a hour flight and they can never be on time. Constant delays for numerous hours its ridiculous! They charge a arm and a leg for everything. You have to pay for a seat on top of your ticket plus 45 to check in a bag and its usually 25.. And that's not including they try to charge you to bring a
Carry on bag. Don't give you anything to drink and you have no leg room what so ever. The most low budge airline you can go with. Even if the prices are low it's not worth it book ahead of time with a better airline. I will never again even if the flights are 5.00!!! There HORRIBLE they should be put out of business"
2013-08-08,Spirit Airlines,2QqI0nH7p7OWwOp_KXBYiA,1,"F- this was the worst flight I have ever taken ,read the reviews before you book a flight with these guys. My flight from Vegas to Oakland was delayed 6 hours with no explanation and no sympathy for the folks who were suppose to get into Oakland at 11:55pm and landed at 4am. Apparently this is a trend with this company and they do not give a damn. They also have hidden fees that after time waiting and paying for bags cost just as much as the next guys. This was a return flight from a funeral , thanks spirit for making a hard day even worse."
2013-08-13,Spirit Airlines,myPeurx2CKRoCGpTTeOR9A,3,"After booking our trip to Vegas for flight and hotel through Spirit and THEN reading all the horrible reviews, I was very nervous about our trip and ready for a nightmare experience.

My fiancee assured me it was only a  2 hour flight, don't worry about it - it was a good deal and it is what it is.

Keep in mind, I did my research on their site and was familiar with their process, fees, etc. so I knew what to expect.  We checked one under 40 pound bag before hand, printed our boarding passes and made sure our personal items were within guidelines.  We also ate and drank before hand and were prepared.

The flight to Vegas was fine and uneventful.  We walked right up to the bag drop and were done at the counter in under 2 minutes.  Which never happens.

The seats are a bit tight - not something I really noticed but I am 5'4"" and petite, but my fiance is over 6' and was cramped.  He is also a Diamond Delta flyer and I reminded him this is not Delta.

When we checked in for the return flight, we saw online the flight was delayed by almost an hour and a half.  We did this about 4 hours before our flight so again, we were able to adjust our day.  When we checked back it had been delayed another 30 minutes.  So final delay was two hours from original departure time.

No other issues with the flight home.  The staff at both airports and on both flights were very friendly and we had no complaints.

I would fly Spirit again IF there is a significant price difference - like $100 or more, otherwise, I would not be hesitant to fly them again if the savings is worth it."
2013-08-14,Spirit Airlines,mVwxm6qSDwINz9vH7bh8Mg,1,"Aside from the fact their rate structure is not honest at all, lack of service is overwhelming.

Just in case you are thinking about the membership, run! I signed up thinking the membership would help defray the cost of my flight. WRONG. Within 2 minutes I cancelled. I called Spirit to make sure I wouldn't be charged. They said they would be charging and that I agreed originally to the terms. They were right. I did agree to the terms. The terms are very unclear as to what you receive and don't receive from membership. This is a sham and anyone I can reach to make sure they don't fly Spirit I will not hesitate to tell my story.

2013-08-15,Spirit Airlines,8tmPXOvprxrHCWVMvtnTjw,3,"Nothing too impressive that stood out.  As I read a prior post on here, yes, ""you get what you pay for"".  I was looking for a quick, non-stop flight from Las Vegas to Chicago at the cheapest rate.  I came across a red-eye to get there and a regular one coming back.  Times were fine, flights took off on time.  We actually got in to O'Hare a half hour early, but since the other plane hadn't departed yet we had to stay on the tarmack for the half hour.  Whatever, it was expected to land and exit the plane at 6:30am and that is what happened so can't be upset for meeting expectation.  Bare minimums though...nothing complimentary.  I think water and sodas were $3 each...that kinda bothers me that when you are purchasing a $350ish round-trip ticket that the flight can't give you a $0.50 Coke Zero and a pack of Biscoff cookies...but hey, I slept the whole time both ways so again, I didn't care.  No Wi-Fi, videos, music ports, or anything of that jazz...not even a SkyMall magazine to humor myself for a moment.
The flight to Chicago though was definitely the smoothest I have ever experienced from any airline...didn't even feel the tires touchdown... kudos to that pilot!  And the other comments people made about the planes looking jacked...STFU... the planes are fine, kept up well, clean, and well maintained."
2013-08-19,Spirit Airlines,p_3yaJYYuZ5hIty2PG9ypw,1,"Wow. I cannot fathom how much it hurts me to even give Spirit Airlines one star. They don't deserve a single star to begin with. Spirit does not provide their customers with the slightest sympathy, profit is really what it's about. Not a single breath given to their fliers, but I guess that's what happens when you fly on a budget--right? No, wrong. There are no words to describe how I feel about this airline and their lack of commitment, loyalty, communication and lastly quality service. 

I had a flight leaving Las Vegas at 4:10PM which wan delayed due to late take off from a departing city--I get that. Don't get me wrong, going forward my flight was delayed once again when the plane had arrive due to a severe weather advisory. Also understandable. The very last delay lasted about an hour or so, stating that there were mechanical issues with the aircraft. Ok, ok--you're right, why wouldn't I hesitate boarding on an unsafe aircraft? Of course I did, but arriving to my destination was the most important outcome. From 4pm to 9pm, Spirit decided to cancel the flight leaving LAS to San Diego to Portland. Creating an inconvenience to hundreds of travelers crammed into their tiny airbus carrier. Yes--budget means lack of space, but it also means extremely upset individuals. Leaving the gate to the front kiosk where Spirit claims to provide accommodations for all guest, they shorted over 300 individuals. Only providing the options of a refund or a flight the next day with absolutely NO lodging compensation. Why is that you ask? Oh it was because they decided to lie about what they had expressed during the final delay. I was told that there wasn't a mechanical issue--though it was announced several times, that there was bad air traffic and the weather did not permit departure. Sure, that's a great reason to rip us all of. I just don't understand why they presented the mechanical issue as such a dire situation to delay departure and then lie to protect themselves of accommodating hundreds of guest. Yes, my round trip flight may have been $250, but please spring $50 for a hotel next time you decide to delay my flight 5 hours and cancel as a result. 

Long story short, don't fly spirit. No flight, continue to fight. Don't let spirit ruin your travel plans with their lack of consistency, communication skills and quality service."

2013-08-29,Spirit Airlines,SYVQT331YSSR6UjUkeA5PA,1,"Third World Experience of First (and Last) Flight on Spirit Airlines  (ZERO STAR)

This was the default option for the Expedia vacation.  I had never heard of it but thought how bad can 1.5 hrs. be???? Well, I was REALLY WRONG!!!!

First off: after receiving the confirmation, I went to the site and selected seats.  To pre-select seats, you have to pay anywhere from $5 to $13 or randomly get assigned seats.  Not a big deal--there are no pre-selected seats at the Southwest Airlines cattle call--I'll just check in early.  Then, I noticed that they charge for carry-on and for checked bags other than 1 ""personal item"" (usually a purse for women).  Not a big deal--there are workarounds.

The biggest thing that was BEYOND the PALE was we recently had a death in the family and the service coincided with the day of our return from our trip.  Asking to move the flight forward a few hours so we can attend the service, I was told, ABSOLUTELY, NO BEREAVEMENT, NO MEDICAL, NO REASON WHATSOEVER for a change, but we were welcome to pay $124/person change fee and the difference in the cost of fares.  Luckily, there are also other options and my AP, the deceased sibling, WILL attend the service.

To top insult to injury, when we left, we were charged $5 for a wheelchair for my AP--normally, I would tip this amount for the service anyway, but this highway robbery definitely essentially guaranteed that the employee who hustled my AP in a wheelchair and dumped him off at the gate will not be tipped.  Then, there was the matter of the plane being 2.5 hrs. late for a 1.5 hr. flight--this on top of asking passengers to arrive at the airport 2 hrs. early.  Luckily for Spirit Airlines, I was still enjoying the wonderful lunch I had before I went to the airport.  The final ""oddity"" was the charge for beverages--$4, which is not a hardship for us as we had plenty of time to ingests lots of liquids in the 2.5 hr. delay and to refill our waterbottles.


So, to save a few bucks, is it worth dealing with being nickled and dimed to death, and to be treated like cargo rather than a human being (the handling of the bereavement/medical emergencies, promoting passenger dehydration)--EMPHATICALLY NO!!!"
2013-09-02,Spirit Airlines,1wUsJqMiFb7JzjitC3jqWQ,1,"I am actually writing this review having gotten off the plane after travelling for 12 hours (when the flight should've been more than half that time) on my first and only encounter with Spirit Airlines. I totally regret not having read the reviews before booking my flight - cheap fares are definitely too good to be true with this airline.

Embarked on a flight from Las Vegas to La Guardia (NYC) airport, via stopover in Detroit.

Found out a few hours before my flight departed that there was a charge for carry-on and check-in luggage - $100 at the gate if you don't buy it beforehand! Daylight robbery. So I paid $40 for my carry-on, but when I arrived at the airport asked if this could be refunded as my luggage fit inside the 'test' compartment at check-in. The service attendant basically waved me away and told me I'd have to pay as it was 'outside the dimensions'. Whatever. 

Departure time was 8.12am. After arriving at the airport 2 hours before the flight departure time, and upon arrival at the gate we were told that the flight was potentially overbooked and that they were seeking volunteers to take a later flight. This was the first scare. However the flight ended up departing approximately on time. Too good to be true? Read on.

Arrived in Detroit for a 'brief' stopover. Original time of departure was meant to be 4pm. Passengers were told nothing and it was only until I checked the departure screen that there was now a 2 hour delay, scheduled for 6pm! Went back to the lounge and then was told that the flight would be departing at 5.15pm - no reason was given for the delay.

All passengers boarded for an anticipated 5.15pm departure. It was only when we were all seated and waiting in the tarmac that the captain decided to tell us that La Guardia airport was closed due to bad weather in NYC. Funny though, that a fellow passenger called out that her friend was departing on a Delta plane at the same time and on the same flight leg, yet her flight was not delayed? The attendant did not seem to know how to respond to this. She called the captain and the captain's best line was that the weather was bad and was causing delays everywhere. Not sure if this was true but after reading MANY negative reviews about Spirit on Yelp, it seems that this is not the first time they have acted dishonestly and used the weather as an excuse for their sloppy practices.

To top this off, we were then told we could not disembark the plane (since we didn't know if our flight would actually depart due to the so-called weather problems in NYC) and if we chose to do so, would not be able to re-board! The attendant also let us know that Spirit would not be giving out free snacks or water for the delay, and that they would have to 'seek permission from the company first.' What the hell!? This was now beyond a joke. In my entire experience of flying, I have never encountered such unprofessional level of service by an airline. I don't understand how this company is still in business! 

After waiting on the tarmac, we finally found out at 6.30pm we were able to fly. We landed in NYC at 8.15pm, nearly 3 hours later than the original arrival time of 5.45pm. 

If we really want to stop this airline running altogether, I'd suggest lodging a complain with DOT. I even Googled it and there's an actual website on how to shut down Spirit Airlines!! Check here: http://www.spiritairlinesfacts.com/how-to-shut-down-spirit.html

They were so smug about it when they told us we should have read the fine print online. I don't fly often, and I wasn't expecting there to be a fine print saying I would be shaken down for every penny. I miss the days when they offered yucky TV dinners, peanuts and bottomless drinks instead of trying to sell you credit cards and overpriced snacks.

I'll save money when I can, I'm fairly low maintenance.  What happened on my return flight from Vegas to Minneapolis however was the worst air travel experience I have ever had.

We got to the airport the standard 2 hours before take off and there was about 1500 people waiting in line.  No exaggeration.  Their website and computer systems were down and they had no back up plan.  They were issuing boarding passes manually and it was taking a while.  Their staff was reassuring us though that they were delaying all flights so everyone would have a chance to board.  

We eventually got to our gate and the plane was still there but there was no info on the TV monitors.  And then I turn around and the plane is gone.  About 25 of us were supposed to be on that flight and when we inquired they told us it had already left.  Then no one at the gate wanted to help us figure out what to do.  Eventually after much yelling at them to pay attention to us they redirected us down to the ticketing counter to reschedule our departure.  In total about 40 people had missed their departure due to Spirit's lack of communication.  

We ended up on a flight the next morning meaning myself and many other people missed work.  I lost out on not only money but had to take a vacation day to travel home.  Still waiting on a reply to emails and calls, all I want right now is a refund, I wouldn't even take a free flight in fear of not being able to return."
2013-09-19,Spirit Airlines,B98589r3j1RnOLI9ZDN6YQ,1,"I seriously wish I would have read all of these negative reviews before I bought my ticket. Immediately upon entering the airport, customer service was horrible. The people were SO rude. I then proceeded to check in and print my boarding pass only to discover that they charge $45 for a second carry-on. For that price I might as well check it! Once I boarded the plane and it had already begun the taxi, we were told that we would be delayed by about 30 minutes. I'm still waiting on the explanation for that one. Because of this, and the bad weather in Chicago, I will not be arriving at my final destination until 3:30 tomorrow morning. It was originally supposed to get in at 10:55 tonight. I have pretty much accepted the fact that it is not going to get any better. I'm genuinely concerned that I won't get my checked bag back.

2013-09-20,Spirit Airlines,88PN4_xKdXB071JVUopK1A,1,"I have flown Spirit for years as a cheap way to go roundtrip to florida from chicago.
 I have lost 25,000 miles under their rule that unless you fly within 6 months you lose your miles.  well I don't fly them in the Summer and they don't even have flights other then one that takes over 12 hours.  I'm not going to fly to another place because I'd lose my miles.  Next:  I got a Master Card because they give 15,000 miles enough for 3 round trips.  Are you KIDDING?  The 2500 mile flights are extremely few.  Maybe one a month so they can say they offer the 'fare'.  the rest of the time it is 25,000 miles EACH WAY.  Would you believe that Los Angeles to Las Vegas was 50,000 miles?
The cash fare was $18 round trip .  If someone isn't thinking they tell their assistant to ""book me using miles"".  That's what Spirit does.  They have figured more ways to screw the passenger:

1.  A great one that made Spirit $10s of millions.  A little rule that other airlines do NOT use.  Spirit made a small change and said that a checked bag cannot weigh more than 40 pounds.  40 !   YES 40!.  All airlines in the world say 50.  Ok if your bag weighs 10 pounds Spirit has just had you drop by 25% the clothes you can pack.  40 pounds to 30 pounds.  Now if the bag weighs over 40 -- say 41  yes I mean 1 pound over there is a penalty.  The people next to me paid $90 for bags that weighed less than 50 but more than 40.  that's all profit to Spirit.  And it is also ready:  NON REVENUE INCOME.  It is not from the 'fares' they charge.  Look at their financial statements and see that their non revenue is in the $100s of millions.  YES from baggage, seats, cancelation, late fees, food and beverage, and other bits and pieces they have made almost as much in non revenue as revenue.

2.  Why do you think they have fares for $9 or $19 or $29.  The government gets its taxes on that fare.  then $25 for the seat; $50 for the bag; water etc.  Now they make $80 each way in 'non revenue' that the government does not charge the same taxes.

They found a great loophole and maximize it.  I'd like to say my fee was $10 and be taxed at 20% for $2 and make another $80 that was taxed at 6%.  HMMMM.

3.  The Master Card:  miss one payment on any of your OTHER cards and Spirit card gets huge increases in interest and late fees.  More than any other.

4.  The $9 fare club used to be $29 a year.  Now it is $59 and NON refundable.  You must cancel way before it will be charged automatically to your credit card.  

5.  Credit card is free first year.  They promote as you know at the gate and ON THE PLANE.  Please sign up for the free Master Card and get 15,000 miles enough for 3 round trips.  FALSE ADVERTISING.  but if the flight attendants don't offer the card they can be FIRED.

6.  The card used to get you in line to check in separately and avoid the wait at check in.  NOT ANYMORE.  Just wait.  No benefits here.

7. A few days ago we flew Orlando to Ohare.  Pilot announced good news bad news.  Good was that we landed 10 minutes early.  Bad news is that we had to wait 30 minutes for an open gate.  weather was fine and sunny.  Well 2 hours and 40 minutes later we deplaned.  yes -- had they waited 3 hours they would have been fined $27,500 per passenger for 3 hour delays.

Oh over 2 hours on TARMAC they have to supply you with water and food.  We got an 8 oz bottle of warm water and -- ready -- a tiny cracker!  NOT KIDDING.  That's their food and water.  

8.  bottle of water on plane is $3.  Before you get on it is $2 at airport.

9.  Carry on that is stored above your head costs more than checked.  And checked may take 30 minutes to unload.  so people pay more to carry and Spirit makes more because they are inefficient.

10.   They stole refunds of $400 from me.  I canceled a flight 3 months in advance and was told I had a credit of $600 minus $200 for cancel.  Ok at least I'd get $400 back.  So I flew on another airliine since my plans had changed.  About a month after my original Spirit flight I went to book a new flight on Spirit and gave them the flight confirm code for my credit.  ARE YOU READY.

""Sir you didn't show up for the flight so you lost the entire $600"".  Are you kidding?  Of course I didn't show up I had canceled.  ""Sir we have no record of that cancelation""  You didn't show up,.  Well I figured this 'trick "" out too.

Spirit used to give a VOUCHER number for a 1 year credit.  They would know you used it or not.  they changed the voucher to using your original flight code.
so if you cancel and book before the code/flight would have taken off you're ok and can use it.  But forget the one year.  If you go to use the credit after the flight would have taken off, Spirit just says  ""YOU DIDN""T SHOW UP"".  How can you disprove that?  Of course you didn't.

Yes I spoke to someone in INDIA or PHILLIPINES.

I should have asked for an employee name (they lie) and a number or record it to prove.  Even my secretary was on the phone when it was canceled so both o"

2013-09-26,Spirit Airlines,n1vPPx0hUMNOgtnxLrq0rg,1,"What does Spirit Airlines have in common with a carnival barker?  My first flight with Spirit Airlines will definitely be my last.  Like the carnival barker while on-line shopping for the best cost effective flight, the pricing of the ticket and the promise from their website(the barker) of a great airline providing low cost air travel turned out to be a joke.  Once the ticket is purchased I find out I now must pay $40.00 for my luggage each way.  That's $80.00 more Bucks!!!  The Barker tells me to join their fan club for $59.95 and save$10.00 both ways.  Not hardly, that's $39.95 added on top of the $30.00 I still have to pay,thus luggage will cost $99.95 to go with me.  Oh, and if you wait until you get to the airport to handle your luggage it's even more.  As I boarded the plane I was pleased to see a clean new plane.  That was however, my last pleasing experience.  The seats do not recline, your squeezed into seats too close together, and they charge you for everything you can possibly think of.  Water was $3.00!  Needless to say I refuse to pay for water at restaurants and airplanes.  I didn't go to the restroom on the plane so I can't tell you if they were charging a fee to enter or if you had to buy paper.  I can tell you I will never consider them again.  I ended up paying more than I would have on two other airlines...my fault.  Unless, your next flight is very short and you will be in the uncomfortable seats for less than 30 minutes, no price savings is worth and the price savings does not exist."

From LV to Oakland: our flight, originally scheduled at 10pm, is delayed until 1am. At 1.40am we all board. At 2am our flight attendants tell us they are as tired as we are and that we should not take out our frustrations on them. While I don't support being rude to employees, this remark was completely out of line. At 2.30am the pilot announces that the Oakland runway is closed, and that our flight crew is about to time out. The cabin erupts in nervous laughter. How does this come as a surprise for our pilot? ""We are trying to reopen the runway,"" he adds. With their incompetence we know not to get our hopes up. We all get out of the plane and resume sleeping on the carpet of the McCarran Terminal B hallway.

We get to the Oakland Airport around 6.30am instead of 11pm the previous night... Ready for a great day at work. Thanks Spirit!"

2013-10-07,Spirit Airlines,RLZhW4ElS4QRUbxhufSqzw,2,"Value airline company that passes the saving to their clientele who proactively adheres to their guidelines. With that in mind the airline itself is very strict when a customer presents a larger or heavier bag. Restricting bag weight to 40 lbs. causes a customer to consider packing lighter than normal, but is a terrible business practice to actually experience. For a visit lasting longer than a few days, many people may experience a $25 overweight charge per bag when packing for their trips.

As for the customer service I've experienced by the airline at McCarren, I found the service to be friendly and quick with little to no issues during our check in process.

So if everything is fairly decent why is the airline rated 2 stars? It is simple, the interior in the actual flight is cramped and the worst experience I've ever occurred. Everything is tightly packed into a dirty modern airbus that is so tight and lacking amenities it really changed the experience for its fliers. Seats do no recline, gum stains are on the floor, the drink menu offers several options however the plane does not have them in inventory, multiple technical issues with their planes and computer systems prolonging flights, and just an overall experience that lacks what some may expect as common service expectations. 

2 stars it's priced well but it is what you are paying for that you need to consider prior to choosing Spirit - a subpar experience with many cut corners fliers have come to expect as a normal flying experience."

2013-10-13,Spirit Airlines,XLrevfxXOyxxHY1yXxPLfw,4,"I booked a flight on Spirit airlines and flew from Las Vegas to Houston and back this week.  I booked with Spirit because I was looking for a cheap flight on short notice.  After I booked the flight, I began reading the reviews. I usually read the reviews before I make a purchase and not afterwards.  I was thinking I probably made a mistake based on the negative reviews on Yelp.  

I opted to check one bag and purchased seat assignments.  I arrived at the airport and was surprised to find 5 Spirit Airline employees working the check in counter.  They were very friendly and efficient, and the process went smoothly.  The rules were clear about the 40 pound weight limit, so I weighed the bag before I went to the airport.  The plane we were taking arrived from Chicago, and they loaded the plane very quickly.  We pulled away from the gate 10 minutes early, and were in the air before I scheduled departure time.  Upon arrival in Houston I only waited about 5 minutes for the bag to come out.  

On the return trip check in was a breeze.  This time the plane coming from Chicago was about 15 minutes late so we were about 15 minutes late departing.  Upon arrival in Las Vegas I only had to wait about 5 minutes for the bag to come out.

Overall I was very impressed with the flight and the service for the price. I had a much better experience then I've had on several other major carriers."

The flight out of Vegas was delayed about 45 minutes, but I had sort of anticipated that. The return flight from San Diego went off without the slightest hitch. They charge for bags,  but you can carry a ""personal"" item for free. I was able to fit everything for my two-dayer into a backpack and carry it for free. Beverages and snacks are extra too. Three dollars for a soda and even more for beer or wine. I have yet to take a long trip via Spirit, but if you plan accordingly, a short trip can be extremely cost effective. It cost me less to fly to SD than it would have to drive. The entire Spirit staff was friendly and attentive both legs of the trip. My buddy won't agree, but I'm going with four stars.

I think they have many mechanical problems that they do not want to share.   I dug a bit deeper and saw our original plane come in from Florida.

As I am writing this the aircraft to LAX just announced they are now delayed because of maintenance .  Wish me luck as I am about to board to Oakland.

But on the way back home, our flight was delayed TWO HOURS, from mechanical issues back in Chicago.. After boarding the plane, we waited an additional 45 minutes at McCarren, so they could fix ""some minor issues"".. A lady in the seat in front of us had got up to address her concern to one of the flight attendants, and they were COMPLETELY IMMATURE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and DISRESPECTFUL. The male who she had spoken to got on the phone, and kept direct eye contact with the woman who had gotten up to speak her concerns, giggling with the female flight attendant as he is on the phone, there forth making the woman uncomfortable. They proceeded to whisper and laugh in the front.. All that is going through my mind is ""REALLY?? HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA FLIGHT ATTENDEES??"" This was my biggest concern. Our whole row got neglected the rest of our three hour flight by those two attendants, because they simply did not want to deal with the miss who spoke her mind.. The captain seemed calm and collected, nice enough.  I overall didn't like this airline, and would not recommend.

Spirit Airlines isn't terrible.  The airline delivered and took me to my location in one piece.  However, since this airline is significantly cheaper than other carriers; it appears as if patrons forgo certain amenities:

:::leg room  (This coming from someone who is 5'2""!)
:::a waiting area with seats for more than half of the patrons  (Just imagine people 
   laying on the floor EVERYWHERE.)  
:::adequate staffing  (Budget airlines do not appear to be the most generous with staff 
   salaries or the best with staffing in general.)
:::TERRIBLE, uncomfortable airline seats (Yes, I understand that most airline seats 
   aren't stellar.  However, there are probably the worst that I have sat/crammed my 
   little self in.  If you are over 5""6"" and 150 lbs you will STRUGGLE to fit in one.)

2014-01-01,Spirit Airlines,U_553YTJ5NGULP99rBr7Qw,2,"If you're reading previous reviews, I'd recommend first doing your own research before disregarding Spirit. While it is true that Spirit charges you for literally EVERYTHING, including check in baggages, carry on baggages, water, food, alcohol, and even SEAT selection. But it's like you're ""getting what you paid for."" HOWEVER, I must point out that even with all these extra charges, occasionally Spirit is STILL cheaper than the cheapest flight on expedia, or Southwest. 

The staff is easy to work with and they give you a heads up that if you wanted to be seated together, you must immediately go to the Spirit agent at the door and let them know. I had no problem getting seats sitting together for four people both ways. The staff on the plane aren't gorgeous like other flight attendants, but they are kind and at your service. They don't really pay attention to the patrons during the whole flight, but that's what the service button is for. 

Plane was dirty both ways and seats in the back and small and uncomfortable (I'm 5'3in and my knees hurt). The front seats are bigger and have head rests. I went to Vegas, so the ride was fast (1.5) and we had no problem with any delays.

Tips: 
1) Paying online for check-in and carry-ons bags are cheaper than paying at the airport. 
2) EVERYTHING is charged. DO NOT assume anything is complimentary.
3) ONLY fly with Spirit if it is a SHORT flight. Short flights allows you to take a nice nap and wake up at your destination with maybe a bathroom break (that IS free). In the long run, short flights will be cheaper (all things included - comfortably, price..etc).  Long flights may cause you to want to buy the horrendously priced food/drinks and cause body aches. 

Overall: worth it if you can travel light and plan to go somewhere nearby, or bring your own food onto the plane. Other airlines are obviously better, but this is definitely cheap."
2014-01-02,Spirit Airlines,cXXgCW6w3jwT5e_6fhdOzw,1,"They charge extra for everything, even a carry on. The seats are very small with no leg room at all. Never flying with them again."
2014-01-03,Spirit Airlines,GZX7bdjxtS6tL8PMI8WmbQ,1,"Worst airlines EVER.  And I'm a pretty reasonable and paitent person.  

Took this airline to Chicago last year because supposedly they were ""really affordable"".  Our plane emergency landed due to a crack in the windshield, which is a good reason for the detour I'll admit to that.  However it's what happen there after that really ticked me off!

1)  Detour flight lands in Denver at about 5:30-6AM.  No word what so-ever as to when we'd be getting back aboard or going to another flight.  We each get a $7 voucher which only can be used at McDonalds due to the value, so imagine that line.

2)  3 hours go by and finally someone says we have to all go down to the baggage claim area and grab our lagguages and then drag ourselves all the way back to the check-in desk.  Mind you, this is the entire plane (which was full) that has to do this.

3)  First-come-first serve.  The entire plane then now has to stand in line with only 2 ticking agents to help us.  After 4 more hours of standing in line we get to the agent and the only options we have are to take connectiing flights to other cities (cities not even close to Chicago) or get booked on another airlines and WE HAVE TO PAY the difference.  In both cases we already lost 1 day in Denver, but now we'd lose another 1/2 day as these flights were all the next morning.  

4)  We take a flight that is from Spirit that takes off around 11:30PM...it's only 3PM.  We ask the woman if we could leave our bags behind the check in counter as it would be a hassle to drag (and fit) 8 suitcases around Denver until our flight.  The answer was ""NO.""

5)  Come back to catch this 11:30p flight and there's only the 8 of us and another passanger.  We board a damn hour late of course.  The plane takes off and lands within 15 minutes.  We are now told we cannot use this plane and we need to exit.  Turns out they put us on the same plane that had the broken windshield and they had only fixed it in the afternoon so the thing wasn't freaking even ready.  Smart move by the pilot who actually caught this error.  

6)  No sleep and no shower, we are all p*ssed.  It took us another hour of arguing before we could get Spirit airlines to get us on another flight with another airlines and pay the difference themselves.  We also finally got them to paid for a hotel so we could actually take showers and sleep a few minutes.  They initially did not want to pay for a hotel.  Basically we get to the hotel at 4:30AM.  The flight is at 8:30AM.  Bullsh*t.  So now we get to spend our first day in Chicago sleeply as heck.

7)  The flight back to Vegas was also delayed an hour.  Not to mention the kids in the back of us where acting like idiots screaming and yelling.  The flight attendants did do anything about it until one of them started to barf!  WTF?  This airlines is so gross...worst experience ever.  Period.  

8)  Spirit gives us all a $50 travel voucher with them as an ""apology.""  I told them to keep it."
2014-01-05,Spirit Airlines,xtxV8zgsoYJgcVZxf8UXkw,3,"One of the more interesting companies in terms of consumer complaints and message board negatives. I travel LAS to DFW often.. Bottom line its safe cheap nonstop air to DFW especially if you do not carry or check bags.

Yes the leg room is substandard, but they beat American (currently the only other carrier to fly this route non stop) by 50% in terms of fair price all the time"

You must do everything on line. If not they will chrg you a $100 for ckd bag at airport or $30 on line..  Allowed up to 40lbs ckd luggage
Print your boarding passes or it's an extra $10 a ticket
Seats are an extra charge based on seat. 
Your allowed a carry on as long as its a backpack/ purse ect.. They will charge for carry ons otherwise. 
No leg room 
$3 for water - get food & drink at airport
Overall our tickers were cheaper, but only because we read all of the info & did everything on line.

It really became a joke, every time we mentioned the airline, we said, beware that will cost you an extra $"

I do not mind if it is no frills, but there is a level of service that is basic. For instance, when I go to drop my luggage at the ticket counter    the least I could get is a smile. This is almost as miserable as the customer service delivered by.... Well actually even a grocery store, gas station and fast food joint deliver the basics. Mismanagement at its finest."
2014-02-04,Spirit Airlines,7C6y5u41kenBhLb2Pnh8sg,5,"Ok. Going to update my previous review. Just came back from a Vegas trip. Flew out from Ohare 02/02/14 at 15:40. Flew out on time. Flew back to Ohare at 09:15 02/04/14 (Vegas time) without any problems (AND we were expecting a snow storm in Chicago at around the time we were expected to land). Again, no problems. No delays. Even got to Chicago an extra 15 mins early! 

About the prices...people reviewing on here are crying about the added fees (i.e. Carry on luggage, seat assignments, food and beverage). IT IS ALL OVER THEIR WEBPAGE BEFORE YOU CLICK TO CONFIRM!!!!! 
Upset about the price of food and beverage? Get yourself a damn combo meal at McDonald's before boarding and QUIT CRYING!
I flew out as the Superbowl was happening and the pilot was even giving updates about the score. 
Do the research. Even with all the add ons, you will still save yourself $100s! 
Spirit, you will always have a happy customer flying with you!"

Apologies- the contracted labor from delta that does not actually give a crap about the spirit brand. The guy last week was not lying about the crazy contractors that blow the experience for customers. ""Ma'am, now that I am done with your luggage experience, I will need your ID."" Hmm... But my bag has already left on it's magical journey to the underbelly of the worst plane on earth. Why ever would you need my ID now dumb dumb? ""If I do not get your ID, you will not be able to board the flight."" Well, at least I know one in my party will get there. ""Type, type, click, clack, goes the agent on computer with nonfunctional nails."" After asking to speaking to a supervisor and immediately being met with the same attitude, I realized it was time to cut my losses and run. Emailed customer support because getting a human on the phone is an act of God. Let's see if they respond."
2014-02-09,Spirit Airlines,ZN_6mbpvkEAQAwkKFDo3fw,1,"Spirit Airlines is low cost but horrible service. It is not just that there service is poor, it is intentionally poor. Even when provided the opportunity to offer good customer service, they revert to process they must follow. I once had a flight cancelled and was given a short period of time to rebook the flight or lose my money. When I needed to make the flight outside that period, they denied my credit. I would definitely not recommend them.  If you are looking for low cost and can accept VERY VERY Bad service then they might be ok with them."
2014-02-10,Spirit Airlines,IOycZCE18NxZbqMnP5onpw,1,"I am giving a one star because  there isn't a no star choices. Everybody I heard from people about this airline saying that It is the first time and also the last time.

You think you save money from this airline because it's cheaper than other airline? NO way! You end up pay a lot more than others. I paid my small carry on luggage to check in for $45. My husband won't believe it when I was telling him. I also took it for sure because I carry this small luggage fly every where without problem since I start to fly. I follow the rule that paid it. I did see somebody PAID $100 AT THE GATE. What a rape off. The gate people were so rude!
I am so angry that putting this Nasty review. I wish everybody can see it before they choose this flight.

Plus, No free water on the plane. You have to pay!"
2014-02-14,Spirit Airlines,gnakYq6p0V6Gknn19ISITQ,1,"So, I've been flying spirit for a while now because their initial prices are the lowest. It sucks to pay for baggage and every other tiny little thing that should be more or less free when flying, but it was never terrible. Now, I'm at my wit's end. I will NEVER, I repeat NEVER fly with spirit ever again. The customer service representatives are incredibly incompetent and I hate to sound racist because I'm mixed race myself, but these people CANNOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH and the miscommunication has cost me money, time, and energy. I had to change my flight twice due to an emergency. I called within the 24hr limit or whatever and the woman on the phone insisted ""you no know what you speak on. you pay more money always."" Um. What the fack?! No. I don't pay more money always. When flying southwest, changing a flight--even missing a flight costs little to nothing. Changing my flights with spirit and following THEIR bullshit rules that even they don't seem to understand cost me $438 extra, in addition to paying for my carry-on bag for all of those flights, paying the difference in cost for the flights (which I DO understand), and paying for some other random fee that the woman on the phone informed me she couldn't explain or pronounce. Literally. Spirit, get your shit together before you don't exist anymore. Website is ridiculous to navigate. I am so fed up I wish I could sue! EAT A FAT ROOSTER AND KISS MY DONKEY SPIRIT!"

My first  flight was delayed with 6 hours, they said if I leave the airport and come back later , they may not be there, because the flight departing time might change again and they do not do any notifications about that. I paid extra for my luggage and to select seat. Since the flight was delayed for so long, after an hour waiting at the airport I bought a different ticket with Southwest. A few days later when I had to catch my returning flight, they told me at the check in counter that my flight reservation was canceled   since I didn't board on the first flight. 
After numerous phone calls with them they didn't do or offer any refund or credit.
I ended up buying one more ticket with Southwest , so I can go back home.

Their policy is made to protect them in all bizarre and ridiculous situations. Do not book, I bought their ticket to get a deal and ended up paying more than for a first class ticket!"

Pilot could not decide if he needs to turn left or right during flight. Extra fees for baggage and carry on. Taxes tacked on to each checked bag. Upcharge of 25 for overweight bags that weigh over 40 lbs. I highly recommend not to use this airline unless you are desparate. The boarding gate area was nasty with garbage everywhere. They ask you on the flight to pick up other people's trash. 1 star is too kind for this airline, but that is the min rating."

I booked off Expedia and there was no mention that when I got to the airport I would be PAYING 50$ for a carry on!! Unbelievable! I totally understand the fee for a checked bag but a small carry on? Unreal. The horrible staff said I would still be paying less than a flight on another airline. WRONG. Had I booked the other flight on virgin that was almost booked I would pay 5$ more when booking on Expedia however wouldn't have to spend the 50$ EACH way for my carry on. Now to the problems while AT the airport. I'm flying an hour flight And I'm delayed over 2 hours. Not for weather or something uncontrollable. For ""aircraft maintenance"". Which means the AIRLINE wasn't prepared. And what do they do to compensate? Absolutely NOTHING. I will NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN! And unless they refund my flight or bags or something! I will make sure everyone I know, including my 3,000 fb friends, family, etc know how horrible of an airline this is. I will be surprised if you are still in business within the year.

Leaving Las Vegas, we tried to check in at the counter but got told to use kiosk and asked about carry on. She told us to use kiosk. Again, boarding passes were printed, asked about extra 15.00 for seat assignment, NO! The boarding area was so crowded we sat on the outside of it. No place to sit down near boarding gates at all.
As we finally were called, last section on, our tickets were taken and I was pulled out of line for carry on stating I had to pay 100.00 to use overhead. We did not do this on our way from LAX, were told it was ok, so now we are told to pay 100.00??? The people at the counter were totally rude, we had minutes before boarding and were told we could try and go back down to the same counter we had already been at to ask about  this, or pay 100.00 or miss the flight. We were not the only ones going through this. One woman from Australia was in tears, also flying one way with no problem but not able to fly the other.

2014-04-09,Spirit Airlines,8ya5FR-JWBm-SVjbYTS5BA,4,"I can't  believe I'm reviewing an airline, but I feel like it has to be done because there is too much crap out there about Spirit.  

I'm not going to lie, I was expecting the worst after I read up about Spirit.  But that's all you have to do...READ UP.  Spirit is not sneaky.  They are not getting one over on you.  It is listed that your sorry butt is going to have to pay $100 for your bag if you don't handle it before hand.  Is it in your face?  No.  Are you going to overlook it if you don't do research?  Probably.  But that's on you....these are budget flights, you had to think SOMETHING was different, right?

I don't know what all the stuff about smallest seats ever is about...maybe I've been flying tiny planes my whole life, but the Spirit plane was pretty normal...to me.  I've never been on a plane where I was stretching out in the lap of luxury, so yeah, it was small...but aren't they all?

So, this is my only experience with Spirit, but I flew from Philly to Vegas and everything was great.  The lady that checked us in even offered me a paper bag to put some stuff in when my checked bag was over 40lbs.  So nice!  They boarded the plane quickly and we were off in no time.  The flight attendants are hilariously nonchalant, making jokes and acting like normal humans.  I got a deal on the flight, I'm not sad I didn't get a coke for free.  Get some goodies at the airport before you leave...you'll be fine.

Flight from Vegas to Philly was just as good, we even got in early.  I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about.  Spirit is much like Ryan Air in Europe...it is a means of transportation....not a party.  You get what you pay for, and I paid for a flight to and from Vegas.  Thanks Spirit, I'll be back!"
2014-04-10,Spirit Airlines,38SB8o4yWBp4jnXd2p__PA,1,"Because all of my favorite carriers were asking much higher prices, I decided to give Spirit Airlines a try for my most recent Chicago/Las Vegas business trip.

Let's just say that this frequent flyer (I log about between 40-50 thousand miles per year) definitely has buyer's remorse over his decision to try this carrier.

The planes were or seemed newer.  The planes were relatively clean. The service was relatively decent, but the good points end here.

What I really did not like about Spirit is that they charge just about everything including seats, checked bags, carry-on bags (if you don't pay at booking, they will sock you $100 a piece at the gate for your carry-on), beverages (including water, coffee, tea and soft drinks) and snacks! Paying for checked bags and even seats do not bug me too much but also paying for carry-on, water, soda, and snacks? Okay, maybe I also could live with charging for certain snacks, but charging for the rest of items is simply crazy! Especially if I have to be in an airplane for almost 4 hours?! 

Again, I log about 40-50 thousand miles a year.  I have flown several different airlines. I have flown many ""low price"" airlines.  I travel economy or premium economy. I don't travel business or first class, but I haven't experienced a carrier who has failed to provide the value for me as miserably as Spirit. I have no problems with ""no frills"" airlines, but, when I don't feel the value as a customer, the company has failed. I don't feel the spirit or feel my spirit lifting after traveling with them. Instead, I feel regret for choosing this carrier. Charging your customers for one too many items, little items, isn't going to be a long-term winning business solution. There are plenty low fare carriers around. Most are doing much better than Spirit.

Unless there aren't any other choices, I won't fly Spirit Airlines any longer, and I highly recommend you to avoid it as well."
2014-04-21,Spirit Airlines,hNSxOMeuYvox0ZeUy-8_nA,1,"Nickel and dime for everything,  too long of a boarding time (45minutes extra time of sitting on airplane is ridicules),  usually always some sort of departure delay (who cares if you can sometimes catch up in the air -  you still sit there from the time you boarded). Upgraded first seats not worth it especially when flight attendants are talking loud among themselves the entire time on overnight flights,  also loud banging from flight attendant coverts,  no respect for people trying to get some sleep(I had ear plugs and even this didn't help).    No heads up prior of flight regarding delays,  one time monitors didn't show the delays until scheduled departure time while gate stuff were announcing it over the Airport PR an hour early,  why not give this notice to arriving customers and update airport monitors so people don't have to rush to airport.

2014-04-22,Spirit Airlines,qBl5lmPB7nTSoBf1y2g7Aw,4,"i have to say i had incredibly low expectations of spirit after reading all the negative reviews on here. i honestly dont know what you people are complaining about. i flew from vegas to new york city with a layover in chicago. i'm 6'1, 210lbs and felt like the seats had enough leg room and space for me. as for the fees, i took the time to read up on the bag policies and knew how much it was before hand. even though i had to pay $50 for my bag, it was still cheaper than what other airlines were charging. as for the flight crews? they were great, specially the chicago based crew. they WERE AWESOME. this one flight attendant had everyone on board laughing at all the jokes he was cutting over the loud speaker. it made me forget about how banged up i was after spending a few days partying in vegas. i honest to god wish i could take that crew and place them on any and all flights i take for the rest of my life.

bottom line? if you are low maintenance and are content with bringing your own food/entertainment with you on a spirit flight, then you'll be just fine. i absolutely will not hesitant to fly with them again."

I'm under 6 feet tall and my knees touched the seat in front of me.  There was nothing I could do.  The fees are ridiculous.  3 bucks for water, 30 dollars for a carry on if you do it online, 100 bucks at the airport.  Cheap fares are nice, cheap airlines are not.  Travel at your own risk.

This airlines sucks! Avoid at all costs and don't even waste the time reading anymore of this! Just stay away!

This airline is hands down the absolute worst carrier currently operating in the United States. I have had the opportunity to experience it first hand in several cities and I ask myself why I keep going back. Honestly, I am not always the one booking it and I have no say in the matter, but when I do I avoid at all costs. 

-Awful flights that feel as if the pilots are new on the job or operating a plane that needs to be checked out. I understand turbulence and and such, but no excuse for not changing altitude or a rough landing or takeoff a with dramatic movements every which way. They are old planes that should be taken out of service. I have flown in nicer planes in third world countries!

-Very unfriendly staff! It is like everyone hates their job and they are in no way able to try and assist you. Have had issues with planes being late or sitting on them waiting for takeoff and there is never valid reasons this occurs and never people working there that seem apologetic. Like making you board a plane in 10 minutes and then making you sit there for an hour before take off.

-Zero comfort! If it is not already bad that you have a awful ride and unfriendly people that are helping you... You get to sit on top of the person next to you with zero leg room  and no entertainment options. Total crap in every way!

-Cheap and not inexpensive! These two words seem similar, but they are not at all. This airlines always has the lowest price and even days up until traveling they offer this, but remember to add the cost of water, carry on bags and a number of other add on a that make absolutely no sense. They also have a Scam ring with their supposed saving club. Sign up and even if you unsubscribe it keeps you there and you are required to call after you see it on your credit card statement. Look around they do this to everyone!!!


I try and not get a angry at companies, but this rant is not just me being upset about a bad experience this is total crap as am airlines and I suggest you avoid at all costs!"

Add in the crazy charges for carryon bags, and you've got a company without the infrastructure to create an experience that even approaches the bare minimum. Do not be seduced by supposedly low fares and stay AWAY from Spirit!"

You have to pay for your carryon and checked luggage, talking to an associate at the counter, the peanuts and drinks on the airplane and even to book the seat. If I have to pay for my seat, then what the first few hundred dollars pay for? Makes no sense. Will never ever use Spirit again."
2014-05-18,Spirit Airlines,7XB39pIsvYxVfSXEqOQ5AQ,1,"Spirit airlines is THEE worst airline I've ever flown with. I flew from VA to Vegas and I was appalled that you had to pay for a carry on .. At every other airline you get 1 free carryon and 1 free personal item (such as a purse or a man bag) with them you either pay 25 (50 round trip) during booking, 36 during online check in (72 round trip) , 50  at  the bag drop of (100 round trip ) or  100 at the gate (200 round trip) . Your bag has to be 40lbs and under if it is over you pay an additional amount per how many lbs it is over. The seats were ridiculously SMALL. My flight took off 30 minutes later than expected and arrived an hour later than expected to our destination. Spirit is the worst airline I've ever flown and WILL never fly w them again also if you fly west coast to east coast you pay an additional 18  bag fee for going west to east.


Great job spirit. Secret fees are pretty customer friendly -_- not!"
2014-05-20,Spirit Airlines,-GQFWu5ahdc7VfLjaQaAqg,2,"Spirit certainly has some really low fares. Now that we have that out of the way, I must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline. 
I fly around a decent amount and I've learned what works with them and what doesn't. 
Here's what works: They fly to a lot of cities, a lot of their flights are direct flights without layovers. The staff at the airports have always been pleasant and courteous. They also have great last minute deals in case your flight is An emergency or if you're going on a spontaneous adventure.  People have said that their flights are bumpy and rickety but I've always had smooth sailing
Now, here's what doesn't work. I'm about 6'3 and 210 pounds so I expect to be cramped, but their flights take it to another level. Their bag check in fees are higher than most. Their seat choice fee is higher than mist, hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit. They also love to find ways to nickel and dime the customers.  They also don't have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day, for example the only Vegas to Baltimore flight is an 1130 red eye. It's a deal breaker unless you're flexible. It's also a bit of an issue because if you miss your flight you're straight SOL for awhile
 TL;DR spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if you're packing light. Everything else, I'd generally recommend paying the difference and enjoying the comfort"
2014-05-20,Spirit Airlines,UcLIruKb1mn_z767xcSGyg,1,"Every aspect of this company is a nightmare.

Scheduling is a pain- though this airline is cheap, you have to do some detective work to make sure you're getting the best price. Which is why I had to book my guy four separate flights to get to and from a work conference in Orlando: one from LAS to DFW, another from DFW to Orlando, then the same in reverse to return, in order to get the best final price.

First flight was delayed and then cancelled. No contact was made to alert me of this prior to arriving at the airport. Every other airline I've flown has texted and/or called me in a timely manner. Had to make two trips in one hour to our lovely airport to retrieve my guy. Staff had absolutely no ability to reschedule anything or come up with any possible solutions. This airline only seems to have evening/red-eye flights, so next available flight was 24 hours away, which didn't work for the conference we were travelling for in the first place.

Since rescheduling with the same airline was not an option, had to shell out last-minute ticket prices for American Airlines- twice the price. Spirit has very strict policies/rules about when/how to request refunds, and I'm happy someone informed me that they are only able to issue one refund per trip per person. In other words, if your first flight has an issue, don't do anything about it until you have thoroughly completed your travel with Spirit. Because if you have additional issues getting home, they won't be able to do anything. Which makes no sense at all.

Return flight was also delayed, but luckily not cancelled. Which isn't to say it's wasn't without irritation. What was supposed to be a 11PM arrival barely made it around 1:30AM. Luckily I didn't have work in the morning.

Overall flight experience is miserable. Tiny-ass seats, very strict luggage requirements, steep fees for every little thing, not even water is free of charge in the air. Basically, you can only travel with a lunchbox unless you want to shell out $40-50, because they will literally charge you $100 at the gate to CARRY ON a bag. Even if it's a duffel bag. Because lord knows if you ain't got no leg room, your weekend bag isn't likely to fit under the seat in front of you, either.

**IF YOU ARE CARRYING ON LUGGAGE, take your bag to the airport and make sure it fits in their little container. Otherwise, the fees you pay will eliminate any savings you get on the ticket price. Consider yourself warned!**

I love saving money, but I wont be doing this again."
2014-05-23,Spirit Airlines,U8_0PxJ5843pApqY2S89oA,1,"WORSE AIRLINES EVER. EVER! ... EVER!

They charge you for everything. Even the complementary peanuts you're suppose to get for free. Carry on is $50 so pack light guys. The inside of the place is disgustingly dirty. The seats are crammed so close together that even I can barely move and I'm 5 foot 100lbs! That's an exaggeration, I was able to move but barely. I  just cant imagine someone being comfortable sitting there. The person next to you is basically shoulder to shoulder with you. So hope the stranger next to you doesn't have a woundering head when they sleep. 

Now lets talk about punctuality. Spirit Airlines do not believe in arriving and leaving in a timely manner. It's not in their vocabulary. There is always something wrong. Always. 

Our flight from LV to Chicago had to do an emergency landing In Denver due to a cracked window. Let's just say, my group of friends slept on the airport floor, was fed with $7 food vouchers, endless waiting, after 20 hours stuck in Denver they put us on the same damn airplane with the cracked window! Went up in the air and went right back down. Wtf right. Arrived to Chicago with United airlines (waaay better). Leaving Chicago, we had to ride with Spirit again (not by choice already purchased ticket) & that will be the last damn time I will. Delayed due to the AC being broke. Surprise. The turbulence, I will never forget. I literally thought I was going to die. Like for real. Little kids in the back screaming, people barfing behind me. It was every airplane thriller movie I had seen brought to life! 

They've contacted us trying to give us a $50 voucher to use with their airlines. Yah no thanks, I'd rather walk."
2014-05-25,Spirit Airlines,l1cWN93ZCY32DfIKJ5jqkg,1,Spirit Airlines has some low fares and I have to say my flight was on time. Now with that being said I will never fly Spirit Airlines again! I can't believe I had to pay $50 for my carry on luggage and then an $136 for our seats! Then on top of that pay another $5 for a bottle of water and orange juice on the flight!
2014-05-26,Spirit Airlines,-6ZpvenDks889JB45ZhQ1w,1,"The worst airline ever!!! I didn't even fly with them and they were horrible. I had an emergency so I had to take an earlier flight (with another airline btw b/c they had nothing available).  When I contacted customer service to see if i could exchange the flight ( I would've understood a cancellation fee), the told me that I forfeited my flight and could not get a refund or exchange. So basically they stole my money. Never again!!!"
2014-05-27,Spirit Airlines,eEQKDUlUWgoXh2FprzZjCw,1,"It was a new airline and we thought to give it a try. And we were wrong. Coming back from Vegas to Oakland, our carry-on fit on their ""size"" check perfectly, but they want to charge us $100 because the wheels of the carry-on bag stick out a bit. We weren't going to pay $100 so we tore off the wheels.  It's was worth the fight since we can spend that $100 for a better carry-on instead to the Greedy airlines.  Never will flight spirit again. Our spirit is not with them anymore!"
2014-05-27,Spirit Airlines,uozMqsD0Ru4fD1o3-yZHaw,1,"The worst airline I've ever taken! We had a carry-on roller with us outbound to Vegas with no charge as almost all DECENT airlines are. To our horror however, flying back to LAX we were to be charged A HUNDRED DOLLARS for the same carry on bags we had flying in! They were gonna charge us $100 for each bag at the gate telling us they were not going to hold the plane if we decided to check in the bags which were gonna require us to go downstairs to the check in counter then the security again and back. They said they didn't offer valet either.  Oh, the charge for checking in each bag was gonna be $45 by the way. Isn't this called highway robbery!? This should be completely illegal! 

I ran into the nearby souvenir shop and got us a huge shopping bag to transfer all our stuff from the original bags and saved us $200, 3 minutes to spare before dept time. I HATE SPIRIT AIR, I swear!!"

Due to a family emergency, we had to cancel a portion of our trip and not only did I  loose my ticket but had to pay extra to have my luggage changed to my husband's reservation.  No matter how low their fares seem, it's not worth this horrible rip off. Worst airline ever, and we've flown with many no frills airlines, this is the poorest."
2014-06-03,Spirit Airlines,IAhb-z2OIU92iK7PNcjlKQ,1,"THE WORST!!!!! Horrible seats, only 40 pound luggage when all others are 50 pounds, seats were uncomfortable,  flight delayed because one of the flight attendants didn't show up. Tried to swith passenger name and after hours of fighting with customer service the passenger who didn't even pay for their ticket (MY credit card used) got a credit that will never be used. I was willing to fork out more money to the company but instead they screwed me over ROYALLY.  I have and will continue to tell people about my horrible experience.  I will NEVER use the airlines again, and feel like a used customer.  I will encourage everyone I know also to never use this airline either."
2014-06-03,Spirit Airlines,MPrpCwwxMbQpzCt0DvqUrA,1,"My friend warned me about Spirit Airlines. It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here. I decided that the one time I would be on Spirit Airlines is for a quick flight from LAX to Vegas. It would only take 45 minutes and it will be worth the price. I can deal with the worn out seats, the cramped space, and the additional charges for luggage because I know that it is a discount airline. They will nickel and dime you ($100.00 +) for additional luggage carry on. It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.

The plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. 

The second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.

Third issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. 

Unreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. 

On another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US. I just hope they look into replacing their airplane engines if they are honestly the fastest growing airline."
2014-06-10,Spirit Airlines,Xs-MWZvxVua-WOcmrdootQ,1,"Wish I could give them ZERO stars.  Cheap flight, sure.  I booked through Expedia and paid $650 for round trip dallas to vegas including 3 nights at New York Hotel for 2 people.  HOWEVER when I went to check in I had to pay an additional $258 for each of us to have 1 carry on and a crap ton of additional fees.   WTH!  They suck you in and then sucker punch you.  You want a soda, charge.  You want coffee, charge.  I'm surprised they don't have a pay toilet on board.  

Save money, fly Southwest.  You can even fly American cheaper than these rip off artists.  

Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention. NO LEGROOM on the plane.  If you want to pay an additional $25 you can get an exit row."

I'm an MD Anderson patient that usually flys to Houston from Las Vegas weekly for treatment.  I have missed treatments because of being 4 hours late.  It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't always have a reason to blame it on something or someone other than themselves.  Sometimes the staff is great and other times they are like drill instructors.  One time we were on the tar Mac for 3 hours waiting for a gate.  Another time in the airport waiting for a crew for 7 hours.  The customer service is non existent.

I realize they advertise as an ultra - low cost carrier, but I've flown with other carriers that advertise the same idea and I've had far better service. 

I think what really bothers me is Spirit is constantly 1 hr to 2 hrs late. Also, they are very unorganized and the customer service representatives at the desk like to take their sweet a** time. 

Never again, Spirit. Never again."

I read their ""Optional Fee"" section on their website so I would avoid spending any unnecessary fees. Sprit does allow you to fly with a free personal item as long as it fits the following dimensions: 16""x14""x12"". I was able to find a small weekend bag that fit the dimensions. The bag is actually really spacious and I was able to fit more than enough for the weekend trip. The flights were on time and were really smooth. I'm 6' 2"" and the seats provided ample space for me. There wasn't any inflight entertainment, but then again I wasn't expecting any. Overall, it was a really pleasant experience. I saved a couple hundred dollars using this airline. Two thumbs up!"

I have no need to repeat what has already been said here: the surprise fees to check bags,  the ticky-tack,  sticker-dicker pricing,  and the inaccessible customer service all goes without saying.   My flight was delayed 5 hours,  too - -  no big deal,  the usual course of business for Spirit.   

What I would really like to commend Spirit Airlines on,  was canceling an entire part of my journey,  only to attempt to resell it to me 20 minutes later for 20% more than what they refunded me for.   To the desk-worker's credit,  Michelle did a great job of eventually getting me my fare back,  with a a promised refund (I will upgrade to 2 stars when this refund comes through). I'm still waiting in the terminal as I write this review,  if the pilot succeeds in not engaging on a crash-landing on my way to my destination,  I will upgrade to 2 stars."

To start, 
customer service: the staff that works for this airline is the most un professional, rude, lazy group of Personell I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Literally DMV deserves more stars. They insist you do everything on the self served terminal, which is fine. But if you dare ask a question, not one single person is even SLIGHTLY willing to help and they treat you like the trash airline they work for. 
Prices: although you may think the base price you're paying is a steal, don't be fooled. Everything within this company has a fee. Carry on bags, unless the size of a purse; has a 50.00 fee (however this fee changes between locations, so it goes up in excess of 100$$) Want to guarantee you sit next to the person in your reservation? Another fee. Sodas; a fee. 
Comfort: everything is DIRTY. Most seats are broke. Especially arm rests. No seats recline.

I checked on flights with other Airlines and found Spirit. Never heard of them. I took a chance and bought the ticket. I'm a super snobby flyer and only fly business/1st class if the flight is over 2 hours, but this was short so I booked the ticket.

They have some seats called ""The Big Seats"" and for $30 I could upgrade, so I did. The seats are actually the size of business class seats on American. Very cool. 

You need to print your boarding pass at home or they charge you at the airport to see an agent. No problem. Wish they had an Android App like some other carries so there is no paper involved. Their website is easy to navigate as well.

They sell beverages and snacks on board which I didn't buy, but at least they are there.

Every person I spoke with who worked for the airline was very friendly and efficient. The flight attendant on my return flight, even took my large purse and put it over head for me - she even offered to get it down should I need anything from it during the flight. Wow, awesome. Never had that on American Airlines where I pay a fortune more than this flight.

Anyway, having heard horror stories about Spirit, I was skeptical, but for a no frills airline I survived and was actually pleasantly surprised."

The staff was friendly and efficient, and the flights were on time,  I was surprised to read all the negative reviews.  This ""ultra low cost airline"" does what it is designed to do,  flies you from point ""A"" to point ""B"".  I purchased tickets from Denver to LAX for $112.00 round trip, the next lowest fare was $297.00, the savings was well worth going without a beverage and bag of peanuts.  Now they do charge for carry on bags and it's expensive, $39.00 each way.  You are allowed to take a back pack, make sure you measure before your leave, because they do at the airport, it must fit under your seat.  Charging for carry on bags has it's advantages, since it costs money, most people elect for the back pack, so it is much faster on and off the plane because no one is struggling with their too big carry on bags in the over head compartments.  

One tip, when you check in online it gives you  options of choosing your seats ahead of time, for a fee, skip it.  The check in instructions state that your seat will be assigned when you arrive at the airport.  When I skipped that step and checked in online, the boarding pass had went ahead and assigned my seat number on the ticket.

With the same mindset, I  was boarding my flight from Vegas and I was asked to pay $100 for the same bag which was within specification at Houston.I was not surprised as much by their inconsistent policy abiding attitude as much as I was by their rude staff. It was like they were trained to be rude. All the ""violators"" of their ""baggage policy"" were somehow international citizens. Luckily, I had a big paper bag where I could easily transfer my items and that's how a dodged the $100 extortion amount.  I was definitely not ready to pay $100 for a bag that costs $40.

What I don't understand is their customer service lack of service. Flight delays, gate changes, flight cancellations are all just swept under the rug as though nothing has happened, I have never once heard ""We are sorry for the delay, we are sorry for the inconvenience"" What is up with that Spirit? Do you not understand that we too have problems with delayed, cancelled flights! You have caused me many headaches, and each time I try to keep it together and hope that it will all turn out okay in the end. Well this time takes the cake! What started out to be a simple LAS to MSP trip using the redeye in each leg wound up costing me $792.00? Why? That was my question; I had to change/modify my return flight due to a death in the family. I could not understand the so called customer service rep on the other end of the telephone located somewhere in India that I had to travel to MSP for clarification. And then was told, call the insurance company and they will help you. 
Sadly, many people will read this and thing, ""WHATEVER"" - just remember this review when it happens to you; and trust me, it will happen!
Customer Service! Depending on the call you could be charged $15.00 for the call. 
Here it is today, 2 days back home, delays coming home, (should be used to that by now) and I figured I would call the Insurance company regarding my ticket changes fees of $250.00. I explained what had happened - here is the kicker....""Unfortunately, Spirit does not cover for death by suicide"" 
I could go on and on about this, but before I write something that I will regret, I will end this by saying that Spirit Airlines, owned by Southwest, should be ashamed of their lack of compassion for their travelers with small children, the elderly, people on a schedule that do miss their connections and as a result miss the reason for flying in the first place. Spirit continually has their hand out for our money and never once will they give anything in return; a simple apology works wonders. 
I don't know who oversees this operation, and perhaps this is how they are trained, to be mindless robots working at minimum wage, but I am done with Spirit. This was the last draw. Hello Sun Country!"

Not only do they find every opportunity to gouge you in price, but they are also over booked, delayed and vulturistic (yes, I'm so angry I made up a word) in their practices.  Upon check in, I was gouged $10 bc they don't have clear signage that states that check in is a TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE YOU MUST FIRST GO TO THE KISOK. You actually don't see the $10 indication until you are right in front of the teller. Then! It's too late, because you've already stood in line 40mins and are running late for your flight. Next, you discover that it will cost you $50 for a bag, whether you check it or carry it on with you! Since you must pay for everything that is not a purse or a laptop. When questioning these fees, you'll love the scathing yet lethargic response you get from the Spirit staff (however, I'm sure that they're so used to it that they just blank everyone out). Finally, the best part? Is a hr long delay for ""scheduled maintenance"" - please tell me, if it was scheduled, why do we need a delay? And yet, we're still not going anywhere. As I submit this review, we have another 45 minute delay to cool off the plane. And, the one that made the announcement? He sounded as if this could end up being a longer delay.

So, a nice two hour delay sitting at two various gates.  And hat do they offer us for all this trouble: A granola bar.  Woo, that sure makes up for it.

Finally made it to Phoenix and vowed never to fly them again.  Three trips with American Airlines, delays of two hours on two of the three, all mechanical issues.  Just too paranoid how decrepit their fleet is to really trust them again."
2011-06-02,American Airlines,ag_CtK-W76RfwV7bVVFo-A,3,"with airlines, always hit or miss. delta by far my worst experience on one flight, excellent on the next. american airlines....for our most recent vacation, just run of the mill. 

we were boarded quickly and efficiently. in the turks and caicos, our flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue, but then we got to spend an extra night at the Beaches resort (free food and alcohol anyone). although it did take them 5 hours in the crappy providenciales airport to let us know the flight was cancelled, but 30 minutes later, i was happy as a pig in slop with 2 mixed drinks in my hand and 3rd on the way, with 4 or 5 more to go.

2013-06-24,American Airlines,IqLLX7nqTBjYySNgQgy1pA,1,"Seasoned flyer here and beside myself in disbelief with AA.
I have to say that all of the employees I dealt with were great. My issue is with the operations of check in process. 
In 2003 and 2004 I flew over 106,000 miles on this airline. What the hell happened to this company? 

I couldn't check in online. Called and there were 5 aisle seats (as well as others) but they told me the airport had control of the seating and I couldn't obtain a seat even if I wanted to pay for the premium one. I had to get my seat when I check in. 
Get to check in and they tell me I have to get my seat at the gate. Get to the gate and nobody is there. Wait 20 minutes and the gate attendant (who was very nice) walks up and turns everything on and tells me the flight is full and she cannot assign me a seat. I told her that I called yesterday and their were 5 aisle seats available. She said there aren't any seats available at all and she was going to be calling for volunteers to give up their seats and take a later flight. 
She said she would call people up to assign seats. 
What a completely inefficient and painful process. 
Why do they make it soooo painful to use their airline?
Take a lesson from Southwest and think about the customer experience and cater your operations for them."
2013-07-16,American Airlines,s2wxXcpC-np9xjEBtQ1wpA,4,"Eugene O'Neill's most famous play is called: ""A Long  Days Journey into Night.""  That's how I feel just about now.

Our return flight from BOS on American Airlines was suppose to connect into DFW before taking us home to PHX.  One problem, after arriving earlier there was no aircraft sitting at the Gate @ 7 am.  Turns out there was an ""equipment issue"" and our flight was being delayed three hours until the ""Ferry Jet"" arrived.

In the old days, an airlines representative would scoot out with clipboard in hand and help you with your ""new"" connections.  Well, that didn't happen. So, we started searching for a friendly face at a nearby Gate.  My first attempt was a strikeout and so was my second, but on my third I hit pay dirt.

Turns out that the ""new"" American Airlines, which is really the old US Air, has the ability to move us from AA to a US Air flight.  As it turned out it was also a pretty full non-stop with only four center seats available.  So much for us sitting together, but a non-stop flight home, IS a non-stop flight home!

So kudos to the American Airlines folks for making our long days journey into night a happy one."

Also, call it ego and the need to have status; I like status. I finally made platinum this year and there are so many platinum's not it's not a big deal.  I like to board early to put my carryon items away and I like to be able to show and go stand by for an earlier flight without a charge...
When you book, choose choice essential as if you need to change your flight times there will not be an extra charge or if you want to select your seat in advance you will not be charged.
The new aircraft A319 that they have started flying are awesome. These planes are clean, have more cabin room and your own personal entertainment center although they do charge you for the premium channels.  
Ok so blah, blah, blah complain all you want and yes we do have bad experiences from time to time but if I can have an uneventful flight and travel experience then I am good to go. Keep on flying."

2014-04-17,American Airlines,quMUURs2mXpyLEt-c6_oqw,1,"I posted this on US Airways but since you merged I figured it was deserved on all your pages.

Sharing my experience. My flight from San Francisco to Phoenix was 35 minutes behind schedule.However I was fortunate (or maybe unfortunate) to have a 1 hour and 10 minute layover in Phoenix. Not sure what happened but when arriving in Phoenix I only had 24 minutes to get to my next gate by the time started deboarding it took about 10 minutes for the plane to deboard enough to get to me and the door. As soon as I got off I ran from A25 to B2. I'm a pretty good runner and I was able to run on the fast walkways which helped. I literally got to the gate at 8:01pm and the plane leaves at 8:10pm. As soon as I ran up they pointed me at another lady and said go talk to customer service and pointed a little aimlessly to who I thought was another lady that was going to get me on my flight. I asked the other lady who I thought I was being directed to if she was customer service, she said no customer service is around the corner. I had a sinking feeling at this point. I waited in line behind two other people and was up to the desk in a few minutes as it was 8:05pm by this time. Customer service said they could not let me on the plane. No other flights that US Airways could work with and they had none for the night. I am stuck in Phoenix for the night. They did give me a hotel, but my clothes were checked in complementary checking as they ran out of overhead space on the previous flight. A couple of things that could have been done very different, as well as impacts to my life.

1. Typically when flights are behind the airline asks that anyone having a tight connecting flight be allowed to deboard first.
2. A minute late to the gate seems ridiculous to not allow me on. Maybe you boarded quicker than expected but you knew I was coming I would have expected you to accommodate me especially when you are the same airline that screwed up in the first place.
3. I don't have any clothes to wear tonight so I'll be in my work clothes, and have to get up early to fly back to SLC in my same clothes. It would be nice if you had a complimentary kit for me even a long t-shirt or something that I could use.
4. I was told well at least you get a free breakfast at the hotel. Nice looking at the positive until i get to the hotel and find out my flight leaves to early for me to enjoy the breakfast. It seems like it just keeps piling on.
5. My family was sad I have two little children at home and they are sad that their daddy was coming home like they thought. My wife also said she was sad but she likely is happy she get s a big bed to herself.
6. We had to interrupt my job I will miss out on two key meetings one internal and one with a client.
7. It will interrupt my wifes work to allow for this flight delay. I miss out on half a day of work time, and my wife now has to miss work time to come get me. I did ask the customer service rep how that works and she says well we don;t offer a service so you can pay for a cab and then call customer service and see if they can do anything. That comment didn't instill any confidence especially when the results from this company have shown that I shouldn't trust them.

If the Airline would like to reach out to me feel free. I would like to see how we can change this post into a more positive one but I will leave it unchanged until you contact me."
2014-04-28,American Airlines,BLrsBgRmDqvVd-TgXUXttQ,1,"American is merging with US Air, and boy, do they love to blame US for their own scheduling problems.  If you are arriving late to a connecting flight thanks to problems with your US Air portion of the flight, American will just hand you a ticket for a later flight as you get off the US Air plane despite the fact that American knows that your connecting American flight is still  stuck at the gate with mechanical problems. 
You will have to run through the airport yourself to see if the plane is still there or not.  American sure isn't going to tell you.  You then finally get on the plane- totally out-of-breath-board the plane after the gate rep finds you a new seat- yours was canceled- only to get text messages informing you that the plane you are currently sitting on is delayed- over and over again.  No kidding. I am sitting on the plane, kinda figured that out for myself.  I can only imagine how frustrating that must be to read for the passengers who had not run over to the gate but had just resigned themselves to taking a later flight! 

In their emailed response regarding their poor service, American drones on and on about how challenging their merger has been.  They also blame government regulations.  Really?  What do government regulations have to do with American's choice to not inform passengers that their ""missed"" flight is still sitting at the gate due to mechanical problems?  Talk about passing the buck."
2014-04-30,American Airlines,l-DS5wA3BnzD_Lo2S-PEVw,1,"I have never posted on Yelp before, but considering the absolutely horrible experience I just had with AA, I feel the need to post this wherever I can think to do so.

My sister and I were returning from a funeral in Florida home to Phoenix.  We had a connection in Dallas.  Our first flight left late because our plane arrived late (and because a teenage passenger fainted in the aisle while we were boarding the plane).  We had only a few minutes to make our connection, so when we arrived in Dallas, we ran to the connecting gate, only to be told that we would not be allowed on the plane, which was STILL THERE.  AA booked us another flight for the next morning.  Then AA issued us vouchers for a discounted hotel rate - they would not even pay for our hotel.  We waited outside in the cold for over an hour, but no shuttle ever came.  We ended up booking ourselves another hotel, and we paid over $90 to sleep for 5 hours, with no clothes or toiletries, because AA would not get us our luggage.  My sister and I were both late to work the next day, we had to go directly to work from the airport (gross), and all AA has done is given us $150 vouchers for future flights.  Given that we paid over $1200 for the two tickets to fly to the funeral, that is really a joke.

I have flown several hundred times in my life, and I have never had a more miserable flying experience in my life.  If I ever have a choice again, I would never fly an AA flight ever.  Period."

First I arrived at the airport in alaska, we were rerouted to american airlines even tho we purchased tickets though us airways. I had to pay for my baggage to Costa Rica ( I didn't have to pay for it on the way back) they told me it was part of the US so I had to pay for baggage.  I was only allowed to check in 30 mintues early for an international flight (really?!). Then on the first flight we had an exit row which was very cold. I ask a flight attendant for a blanket in which he responded ""I will have to ask a first class passanger if they are willing to part will a blanket"" I said don't bother the first class passangers. 
To follow the flight attendants we rude or very short. No notice from the pilot when we were about to land either from the flight there or back.
The flight back was a bit more annoying. First departing from costa rica after we had gone threw the security we were not allowed to bring anything on the plane to drink. And even more so there was nothing not even a small snack offered to eat on a 5 hr flight enough tho the flight attendants were carrying food  from one end of the plane to another so the flight attendants could eat but no one else. I am still in shock that no food (even peanuts) for paying customers was offered on a 5 hour flight. I will honestly say I will never fly American airways or us airways again."

So yes not only did they move me line to line person to person they wouldn't let my son and daughter fly until we paid more money so we did 40 minutes before there flight and the lady then says nope you can't catch that plane you have to come back tonight about eight hours later not really caring that there grandmother drove four hours to meet them on the other end and now the old lady is stuck at an airport wondering were her grand kids are.

I should have known better to give them a second try after my first terrible flight! At the gate they told me to take my 13 mo out of the stroller and leave the stroller in the designated area to be put under the plane. Then when we picked it up the handles were shredded and the bar from the handle to seat was bent on one side and the frame was wobbly. Mind you, it was a new stroller used no more than 10x. Then when I reported it, they told me they could do nothing. I called customer service and told them what happened and they told me the policy does not assume their responsibility. They guided me online to the site to show me where the policy was. I had to search it and the lady on the phone took forever to find it. If it wasn't clear, how would anyone know? it wasn't on my eticket or boarding pass. Anyway then the lady told me I had the option to bring the umbrella stroller onboard even though the flight crew told me to fold it up. Then she said it was subject to be checked under the plane (at which they will not be responsible) if there wasn't room in overhead bins. I told her there was in front of the suitcases and she said I couldn't prove it. I have everything documented and I will make sure to get this taken care of. I will keep up this fight and call tomorrow again. I will be sending an email and letter. I have already used social media to post to everyone I know how crappy they are. They aren't responsible for anything! Why would my stroller be shredded and bent if it was the last thing o underneath and the first thing off. Oh by the way, I almost didn't get the stroller when I arrived at the connecting flight airport. They had to ""search"" for the last thing that went on the plane? give me a break!

Now!

I flew from Syracuse through Chicago back to Vegas a few weeks ago and despite a 4 hour delay in Chicago (this part was airport wide, keep reading) they couldn't manage to get my bag from one airplane to another. My bag spent the night in Chicago while I arrived in Vegas.

So the next day I made a trip back to the airport to get my bag.

I then asked for a refund of the $25 they charged me to check my bag. I got a mailing address and fax number where I had to send a list of hard copy information. Even though I had already provided the same information in my e-mail before they asked for it.

2011-11-02,United Airlines,RQKgyX9gvLqs_8ex2OG5tQ,1,"This review is specifically for the United customer service reps at McCarran. 

They are idiots, to put it simply. Idiots. 

There is no organization, it's practically a free for all. It doesn't help that their customer base are idiots for the most part too. Seriously, here is a conversation I overheard:
United Rep: Where are you headed today?
United Customer: Ummm... I think Denver, or maybe it's Texas? I'm not sure where I'm going. 

I mean seriously?

Anyway, so the first step to checking in are the kiosks, which is easy enough. Unfortunately, I had to check a bag, and this is where it was hellish. I apparently picked the wrong line because I waited 45 minutes to check my bag. Apparently, the people in front of me in line thought it would be good to book a flight in person, at the airport. I'm not even sure where they were going, but it was probably Neptune based on how fucking complicated the customers and the United Customer service rep were making it. It's not rocket science, people. 

What frustrates me even more is that while the customer booking her flight to Neptune was on the phone with what I presume to be another United customer service rep, the original, in person, customer service rep couldnt push them to the side as the customer booked their flight to Neptune, and checked my bag. 

Luckily, some nice people in the line next to me noticed that I had been waiting nearly an hour and they let me cut in front of them. It took me five minutes to check my bag.

I think in order to make this United hub practice business more smoothly for their customers, they need to organize themselves a little more. There should just be one line, not seven. 

Also, all airline customers should just be smarter about flying. Get to the airport on time, dont pack explosives, don't overpack, and then freak out over an overage charge. Seriously, flying shouldn't be complicated. Maybe if people practiced common sense, people wouldn't  be so pissed to be a the airport. Just a tip!"

The plane is a cramped little prop plane with minimal overhead storage. You get charged to check your luggage (though if it's small enough to carry on on a regular plane but too big for the little prop plane overhead storage, they will check it for free at the gate). About half the time they have to check if they can get us all on the plane due to the weight requirements. There's a steep fee to change your flight. Not much to like IMHO."

Upon picking up my suitcase I noticed a big dent and hole in my suitcase. My husband is desperate to get to MGM because he has UFC tickets that start in a few hours and I piss him off by going to the baggage claim office to show the rep what happened to my suitcase. I spoke to Charlene Lasoz. Our conversation goes like this:

Me: ""My suitcase is damaged. There is a big dent in the top that was not there before.""

Ms. Lasoz: ""You're right it looks damaged, we can get that fixed for you. Do you live in Las Vegas?"" Shocked as I was expecting a there's nothing I can do, but doesn't hurt to try.

Me: ""No, I live in San Francisco""

Ms. Lasoz: ""Are any of the contents damaged?""

Me: ""No, I don't think so."" I opened the suitcase to confirm.

Ms. Lasoz: After I close it and stand it upright she starts hitting the dent real hard and somewhat flattens the dent out. "" Oh it's fine, it did what it's supposed to do by protecting your belongings.""

Me: ""So, you're not going to fix the suitcase?"" Shocked that she thinks by flattening the dent that is fixing the suitcase.

Ms. Lasoz: ""No, the suitcase is not damaged.""

Me: ""Fine, I'm going to file a complaint, let me please have your name and the 1800 customer service number."" If she had just said no in the first place rather than flip flopping on the issue I wouldn't have gotten upset.

A few days later I'm back at the airport and have to pay a $25 check bag fee. I had no problem paying it the first time, but don't feel like paying it again due to UA damaging my suitcase. I pay the fee at the kiosk and talk to the guy taking the luggage. I told him what happened on my previous flight.

Me: ""Is there any way to waive the fee because on my way here my luggage was damaged?""

Luggage Taker:  ""Let me get a manager""

My husband is embarrassed because he said the luggage taker was muttering FU under his breath at me. I spoke to a man named Mr. Aquino and told him what happened including my conversation with Ms. Lasoz.

Me: ""Is there any way to waive the baggage fee since my luggage got damaged in transit?""  I accepted my repair claim was denied and was going to file a complaint.  I was not asking for a repair since I knew it should be handled by a different department.

Mr. Aquino: ""There is no way to waive the fee, but I see your luggage is damaged if you go to the baggage claim department then you can get it fixed.""

Me: ""Great, where is the baggage claim department.""
 
Mr. Aquino: ""It is across the street.""

Me: Being poor with directions. ""Can someone please escort me there?""

Mr. Aquino: ""No, but it is right across from carousel #13""

Me: Realizing I was already there ""Okay, if I go there can I tell them that you said that my baggage would be fixed since Ms. Lasoz said they could not do anything about it.  What is your name so I can tell the baggage claim person that you said it was okay to be fixed""  I found his name by glancing at his name tag as he didn't want to tell me.

Mr. Aquino: ""No, I did not say that.""

Me: ""Yes, you did, you said it could be fixed""  Getting upset and raising my voice.

Mr. Aquino: Raising his voice at me ""I did not, you are putting words in my mouth.""

Me: ""Yes, you did""  Later I realized he probably meant fix my issue not the bag and was trying to push the problem to another department.  I was upset and raising my voice at this point indignant at implying I was a liar.

Mr. Aquino: Walking away from me in disgust ""I am not taking your baggage and getting a Supervisor.""

At this point my husband is mortified. A supervisor comes out, forgetting to get a name I will call him Tall Portly Caucasian Man TPCM.

I tell TPCM the story for the 3rd time as I had already told it to the luggage taker and Mr. Aquino. I showed TPCM my luggage and how it was damaged in transit to Las Vegas. TPCM agreed there was damage.

TPCM: ""We cannot waive the $25 bag check fee, but I can see the luggage has been damaged, did you file a claim?""

Me: ""Ms. Lasoz said there was no damage and did not file a claim for me. I did not stick around because my husband had UFC tickets. I told her I would file a complaint and left."" I still am not asking for a repair. I just wanted to waive the baggage fee and a simple no would've sufficed.

At this point a buxom African American lady came out and told me it was a manufacturer defect of the suitcase and UA had no responsibility for the damage. She did not hear any of my story nor the fact I did not ask for a baggage repair. Not feeling like telling the story again, I tell her I'm filing a complaint about the way this was handled. 

If they had told me no I would've been fine.  Don't waste my time by having to repeat my story multiple times and aggravate the situation by bringing up repairs and then denying repairs.  In hindsight what happened was comical."

While standing to board Red's flight we were approached by a young lady in tears who apologized for asking this bizarre request: can I borrow your shoes just to walk through the check in gate?
Ummm...????
Ever the skeptic, I allow her time to explain - she begins to cry saying that by wont let her cross the boarding check because she's flying standby and wearing flip flops. Note - flip flops are ok for non-standby passengers, but not for her? Red comes through as the hero and agrees to shoe swap until they're past the gate and then everything is fine but... WTF? Isn't it better for United's image to *not* have a young lady sobbing at their gate because she got denied her flight based on wearing flip flops rather than risk *THE HORROR* of a stand by passenger pass through the boarding pass scan area wearing flip flops!? Absurd. The ticket agents showed no sort of compassion for her either. AND on United's website I couldn't find anything about a dress code. When I used their ""ask alex"" feature on their website to ask ""is there a dress code?"" the answer was that they DON'T have a dress code except to dress comfortably..."

Gate check is pretty awesome, when it goes well. This was not one of those times. I explained that I was connecting in Denver and that my final destination was Madison. She explained gate checked bags are the last on the plane, and the first off, so it would be waiting for me on the jetway before I even got off the plane. Sounded like a good deal to me. I stuffed my Denver boarding pass and a few other silly things in the front pocket thinking I'd have access to them in Denver and I boarded. Late. The aircraft was stuck somewhere and the adjusted arrival time in Denver made it so I'd have 12 minutes to get to the gate in Denver and board. 

What this woman, we'll call her Theresa, what Theresa failed to mention is that gate checked bags on one leg of a flight are automatically checked through to the final destination. Doesn't sound like too much an issue... right? 

Well you'll have to check out part 2 where United takes a nose dive into ridiculousness...."
2012-09-20,United Airlines,cs8ZaKu8FfC7_X6_a5pL-A,1,"My adventure began with what was supposedly a 7:00 pm flight. As a good and wary citizen, I arrived early and sailed through the very efficient Las Vegas TSA and arrived at my departing gate by 6:00 pm. Upon checking the board, I saw that my flight was delayed 45 minutes. ""No problem,"" I figured, ""I'll just sip on a $12 glass of wine poured from a $3 bottle at the cafe next to the gate and wait for a bit.""

45 minutes turned into an hour. An hour into two. By 10:00 pm, I was getting antsy. By 12:00, I realized that I actually lived in this town and had no reason to spend the night in the airport. I got in line at my actual gate, where, after waiting 20 minutes, a dismissive little man in uniform told to get in the ""correct"" line, two gates over. THAT line snaked all the way down the hallway and around the corner.

While inching towards the counter, the well-dressed, older Asian man behind me began bitterly complaining. He was supposed to be on the same flight as me, and wanted to reschedule. When I told him what they told me at our actual gate, he shrugged and stomped over there. The very same man who told me he couldn't help me helped HIM right away! It's as if they couldn't wait to speak to him! Everyone else in line was furious. One lady went over there, and the same man sent her back to our line again. Not sure what that was about.

Finally at the counter, I asked why our flight - no other - was delayed. Guess what they told me. No! Guess! ""Weather."" What weather? Where? It's July!! Sunny here in Vegas, sunny there in Seattle (OK, maybe that anomaly alone was enough to ground planes...but I digress...) what do you mean, weather? What were we supposed to do in the mean time? Were there upgrades, other flights, something, ANYTHING that would help us get to where we were supposed to have already been hours ago?

This bitter, dismissive uniformed man then went into a tirade about how the airlines cannot control the weather, and how we wouldn't sue a car dealer for potholes in the road.

Uh...what?

Trying a different tactic, I practically tackled a supervisor as she went whizzing by me. Annoyed, she shouted a phone number over her shoulder, but then took the time to add, ""We can't control the weather,"" before she sped away again. 

Confused by the clear skies and warm air, I asked an attendant at another airline about the eeevil weather that was grounding planes. She looked at me as if I were bonkers. ""We haven't heard anything,"" she said.

Fine. I'll try the stupid number. 

To be continued..."
2012-09-22,United Airlines,nxzsWOFjiRLfuFrKsF_4gw,1,"I used to fly Continental from Vegas to Newark several times a year, and I came to love that airline, especially during the one year I actually made it to Elite status and got upgraded a few times to First Class.  Alas, Continental is no more, replaced by the evil United Airlines. This, then is a summation of my flight back to Vegas last week.  Note that it is NOT my worst experience with United, just the latest.  The worst one is currently in litigation!

1. The agent at curbside check-in was efficient, but the check-in stations were 
FILTHY.  I didn't want to put anything down.  

2. The flight was delayed an hour, which then stretched to two, ending at four.  Original gate agent was snippy and nasty to passengers, even though few passengers ever approached the desk during the four-hour delay, and there was never any harassment on the part of any passenger.  All the passengers seemed to understand that the delays were due to the bad weather, so there was absolutely no reason for the condescending and annoyed attitude.

3. Seats on United are left empty - especially in the exit rows, which NEED to have people sitting in them - because United will not let people move to unoccupied seats mid-flight without paying $109  DOLLARS????????!!!!!!!!!!!!  When I asked why it went from $60 to $109, she said ""Oh, if you want to change midflight, that's the cost.""  This is a tragedy waiting to happen; if there is ever a time that evacuation is necessary and no one is sitting in the exit rows because they didn't want to give in to United's extortion, precious seconds could be lost.

4. Flight attendant made announcement that baggage could be claimed at Carousel 3.  She did not say that it was Carousel 3 at TERMINAL 3.  My flight deplaned at the usual gate, and my husband went to the usual terminal 1.  I did not learn it was Terminal 3 until getting to the rotunda where it now diverges to TWO trams, which was AFTER calling him and letting him know that I'd be at Carousel 3.  He had to go back to the parking lot, pay the parking fee, then drive to the lot for Terminal 3, and pay again when we left.

 The corporate culture of United seems to be to make the flying experience as miserable and uncomfortable for the passenger as possible.  The customer is treated with contempt and disdain, and this is reflected in the attitudes of the flight attendants, most of whom were Continental employees who continue to evince tacit dislike for their new employer.  Henceforth, I will be choosing Southwest over United whenever possible, because I am treated with respect and appreciation.  And judging by the other reviews on Yelp, I know I am not alone.

Karma is a bitch."
2012-09-30,United Airlines,EOSig18BPhVVt4G5QJ-_2g,1,"They really seem disorganized. and still to this day I'm not sure why the United Airlines would take off knowing they didn't have enough fuel to make it to the destination thus having to stop mid-way at another airport to get fuel.  This caused me to miss my connecting flight.  The flight attendants couldn't even give us a decent excuse. They mumbled something about weight restrictions leaving John Wayne airport.   

I'll avoid United Airlines at all cost now."
2012-10-22,United Airlines,NyGh3nWkhnTBFNZZKlP7JQ,3,Love the frequent flyer program and love getting upgraded for free.  United has been getting better lately as they used to be the worse.  Now they suck less so that's better than before and definitely makes me happier to fly with them again.

The plane wasn't the most up-to-date, the staff wasn't very friendly (pretty rude actually), and you can only purchase food - nothing was free (except pop and water). Our flight was on time, and we did have TV's, so that was nice. I just don't know that I would rant and rave about them."

After reading most of these reviews, as I do most reviews on Yelp, and you have to wonder how many of these people are the source of the problem not the company. Until I have an issue with United, I will gladly fly again...oh and this last time I flew I used mileage, it was easy and got me a free flight to Vegas. I'll take that thank you!"

2013-03-29,United Airlines,GDLFfrQn0cyAj5AE0ZevWQ,1,"What's going on with United's reservations??????

I called and tried to see how much it would be to change the date of the return portion of our R/T ticket.  Turned out to be too expensive and told the agent that we would keep our original return date.  No problem until I checked my bank account!

Seems that while the agent was checking for flight dates and the cost difference, he used our debit card from our original ticket purchase several months ago, (without my permission) and almost completely wiped out my checking account with up to 6 transactions totaling $1485.

After many calls and hours on the phone with United supervisors,  they said it was a computer glitch and they were aware of the problem.  United did not actually take the money, but put a hold, (pending) on my checking account.  

I am completely lost for words as United has shown no concern or remorse for the situation they have put me in."
2013-04-01,United Airlines,9L81RkbgDjGeXZQJCB2jew,4,"I guess I'm in the minority when I say I don't mind United.  I try not to fly them internationally since I recently flew to Australia and there were no power ports.  Compare that to Turkish Airlines that had free wifi as well as power ports.  But that aside, I have status with United so I do fly them a lot, and it's usually just fine."
2013-04-08,United Airlines,7S7MJmCkCKDuqtraX83R8A,3,"United recently changed terminal at the Las Vegas airport and they are now located a the brand new Terminal 3. It's mot a big change as far as the gates are concerned as they are still operating from ""Concourse D"", a large remote gate complex. Before if you arrived at the concourse the only option is to take an automated tram to Terminal 1. Well now you have to be careful as there is two tram lines. One for Terminal 1 and one for Terminal 3. If you fly on United you have to go to Terminal 3 otherwise you won't be able to get your checked luggage back!

Terminal 3 has a more modern layout than Terminal 1 and is easier to navigate so it's a nicer experience arriving here on United. United's service for me here this time was a flight between Washington Dulled and Las Vegas. The flight was nice and on-time. Delivery of luggage was quick. All in all, nothing exceptional but still a experience that match or surpasses my expectation which as low for american carriers."
2013-04-08,United Airlines,f3mtGup0_N4ets4joZDA-Q,1,"Worst airline I've ever flown.

But don't just take my word for it!  Just today I read about a study conducted by Wichita State University and the University of Nebraska that ranked United as the worst airline.  This is what prompted me to write my review.

I don't want to call out the Las Vegas branch of United in particular, 'cause they're really no better or worse than any other I've dealt with.  The service was horrible on my recent visit, though.

The only reason our family is stuck with United is because my husband travels a lot and he's part of the frequent flyer program.  Since theirs is one of the crappiest FF programs around, I keep asking him to switch.  I hope some day he will.

The state of the aircraft is substandard.  Seats are uncomfortable, food is barely edible, and most aircraft are lacking the seat-back personal entertainment units that nearly all airlines have these days.  

On our recent flight out of Las Vegas, it became obvious that our flight would be departing late.  As it turned out, we left about 45 minutes after the scheduled departure time.  However, this tardiness was never acknowledged by the ground crew.  The official status remained ""On Time.""  So, don't believe their On Time record, 'cause while it's probably bad, it's not even accurate.

In short, I hope I'll never have to fly United again.  It's experiences like these that remind me to search elsewhere, even if the competitors are more expensive."

I fly about 6-8 times a year, so I don't expect to run into issues when I fly. In fact, I would say 90% of my flights are uneventful and that is just the way I like them to be. Whenever there has been an issue, United has handled them very much to my satisfaction."
2013-04-18,United Airlines,qLBPB07HgUE8CBIdteB_uA,1,"I wish I could give 0 stars.  My flights changed 3 times due to weather... I get that.  
However, when a customer has been awake and inconvenienced for 24 hours and it will be another 18-24 hours (because your crew were stranded due to weather) wrong things to do/say are: ""we aren't ready for your questions, we aren't working the desk yet"" (and then to repeat it more rudely when the customers asks who to ask instead); you don't refuse 3 times to give their boarding passes and receipts back that they show you (Ms. Badu...close I believe); and you don't tell the customer to go wait at D50 (Ms. short dark haired supervisor) and then not approach them for 2 hours (actually no one approached me at all...I gave up trying to get help).
I fly often and will NEVER fly, recommend, or speak well of United.  Here I was eager to try their WiFi too...NO WAY!!!"
2013-05-22,United Airlines,9OTpFy-4RwEfvCpPyiNGbw,4,"I feel bad giving 4 stars after reading all these bad reviews for United Airlines. But I frickin love them! Me and the BF have flown about a bazillion miles on United and we get really great service.

I have never had a missed or late flight and that includes all if my international flights. After flying so much I have learned a few tricks of the trade in United. If you are flying from Vegas and going somewhere out of the country, make sure you do your layover in Chicago. This is only if you are flying in First or Business Class.

United has the planes with the pods ( lay down beds) for both Business and First for their international flights. You can almost guarantee that you will get on one of these planes when you go through Chicago.

They are like heaven when you are on a long flight. The drinks are good, service is good and the food ( I hare to say it) is not to shabby on international flights. It also helps to get the United Visa Credit Card. They give you a ton of miles and United is really easy to work with on using them. I have never experienced a problem with getting  seat using miles. You can even book it yourself online. Hello- how easy is that?"
2013-05-29,United Airlines,xyxhX-z5Gnhly3pHKthHRw,4,"My experience was pleasant. We were the last group to board the plane so we didn't have space to throw our carry on.

2013-06-05,United Airlines,APe6SbwqxDl1H0OQT5h5Vg,1,"If only I could give NO STARS!!!!I absolutely hate United! They lost my parents luggage on May 15th and to date they are still claiming that they are still trying to ""trace"" the bags and they have no record of it ever leaving Las Vegas. We have the baggage claim tags proving we checked in the bag too. I am sure the bag is lost forever but they do not communicate at all with the customer and make no effort to help. They claim they have a liability of up of $3300 but only if you can prove what was inside the suitcase with receipts. Even that is still iffy. The most they would ever do for a customer is provide a voucher. Who in their right mind would ever travel with them again after that.  Who the hell carries receipts of all their items! Honestly, I am sure the bag has been stolen and we will never see it again, but I am so disappointed in how United has handled a customer's belongings. We can write and call their main headquarters and companies all day long and they will not do a damn thing for you. I feel bad for my parents, as they don't fly much and had this unfortunate situation happen to them."
2013-08-21,United Airlines,JADliYrrWQt111wenEJPlg,4,"I usually fly Southwest and miss their convenience. But sometimes I don't get a choice and end up flying United Airlines.

Pros:
-Spacious seating
-Assigned seating
-DIRECTV 
-Outlets under your seats.  You can charge your phone or keep you laptop fired up while you fly. 

Cons:
-Most don't have wifi.  Tough to get caught up on reviews without wifi
-My luck, always delayed
-DIRECTV isn't free.  
-Meals aren't free like they were in the 80's and 90's.  
-Check In and Ticketing:  Regardless where I'm flying from, this takes forever. 
-Bags don't fly free

Every flight experience is different. I've had good ones and bad ones with long delays.  My last trip was another delay, but somehow United made up for it by getting me to my final destination 40 minutes early.  The cons was enough to give United only 3 Stars. I bumped it up because I made it home safe. 

Conversation with my pilot on every trip:
Pilot:  Enjoy your day and thank you for flying United Airlines.
Me:  You have a good day too. Thank you for landing."
2013-09-17,United Airlines,Cs4sbx6-emzFYLvGMkX7cA,1,"The worst start to a vacation ever.  First they load us onto a plane, then there were issues, they unloaded us, then didn't give any info.  After a bit they loaded us back on then stopped and unloaded us again.  It turns out the plane had issues BUT this is not my complaint.

My complaint is during this process the staff were completely rude and not understanding to anyone's needs.  They barked out, ""if your connecting flight is out of Houston at midnight then you'll just have to wait until tomorrow at midnight and we don't have any hotel rooms for you"".  We are the paying customers and the staff seem to think talking down to a paying customers is acceptable.  At least show a little concern or have some sensitively regarding the unfortunate situation...that goes a long ways in a customers eyes!

Maybe the airline as a whole isn't so bad but I'll never know because the staff at McCarren upset me enough that I'll never fly United again and I'll tell everyone I know not the fly with them either."

So basically I am in city #2 but I have to drive back to City #1 so they can fly me BACK to city #2 again??? This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard and makes me realize why we have global warming and so much waste.

All I ask when I speak with the supervisor is to let me continue on with my second leg, and just forget about the first leg. But because of policy, they rather waste plane fuel and not be able to resell the first leg because policy says I have to do exactly as my itinerary says or pay a ridiculous change fee.

So as I am typing this, I am driving back to city #1 so united can fly me again to where I already am. DUMB DUMB DUMB

We needed to move up our flight, as the staff informed us that he may be passing.  When we explained the situation to United, they were incredibly rude and told us that they would charge us an *additional* $900+ to move our flight date.

We decided to fly out via Delta instead, as my wife's mother had unused frequent flyer miles, but were intending to use the same return tickets through United for the flight home.

We called United to tell them that we wouldn't be using the outgoing tickets, but would be keeping the same return tickets.  I was speaking to the rudest person yet, a supervisor by the name of Mrs. Roger and was informed that they would be charging us $400 in 'change fees' to use the exact same return tickets that we had already purchased - unbelievable!

During a time in which a family member was dying and a time in which we did not have the extra money lying around to pay this ridiculous fee, here was this rude person that actually seemed to enjoy our midfortune!

(if you're gonna treat me & my bags like trash then don't do it in front of me at least), 
to the irritated looking guy scanning our boarding passes, to the stewardess attitude, excessive uncomfortableness & freezing temperature of the plane ride, to the broken intercom on the plane.

I'm sorry that the United Corporate must be so bad to them that their employees can't even pretend to like their job anymore.

My girlfriend planned a short vacation for herself and 2 children to see Mount Rushmore.  She used Travelocity, which offered the United transportation.  They were supposed to leave at 6:15 AM this morning from McCarran Airport, but the flight was cancelled.  Why?  She was told that the flight crew was tired and needed to rest.  (Maybe call in another crew?)  So, she had to go to the ticket counter where there was an enormous line.  She stood in line for 4 hours!  Hear that, 4 hours!  And no one cared or once apologized.  Get this, during that time, one of the 2 agents left for a break.  When the agent returned, a person started applauding, which was followed by other applauding.  Know what happened?  The agent told them to settle down or she was going to call the police!  Someone said that they were just happy that there would be 2 lines and were clapping, and she threatened the crowd again!  Is this a foreign country?!  Are we still in the USA?!
Well, 4 hours later, my girlfriend made it to the front of the line.  They wanted to put her on a flight the next day which would get her there at night, she would only have one day there and then have to return.  They offered her a credit.  She planned this vacation for months.  It cost her a lot.  She chose to take a flight out tonight, and risk one of the kids being on standby at their connection in Denver.  The agent said that chances are good that he'll get on.  If not, they will all be sleeping at the airport.

Plane was headed to Santa barbara, where I was headed to a two daybusiness education course . We were diverted to las Vegas for a mechanical failure of some sort, of which they never told us. They just had us exit the plane and wait for an hour before explaining they would not allow us to 're enter it. (Side note: this plane just had a mechanical issue prior to us boarding in Denver. This is purely speculation but if they maintained their planes better this probably wouldn't happen)anyhow were in Vegas! Woohoo right?!  No. I needed to be in Santa Barbara for a class at 730 and they essentially told me the best they could do was get me in by 130 am after catching a bus ... Mmmm mmmm. Doo I rented a car and asked if they'd reimburse me, that got a big fat, probably not. I would suggest not using United, if something goes wrong, well they just don't give a shot. I am now a true United hater."
2012-05-11,Hawaiian Airlines,oLbOBZ6KtA0Jp6Pmv66hKA,4,"I fly Hawaiian whenever possible.  Inter-island and to the west coast.  I find that most of my flights are on time and has never had a problem with my luggage (knock on wood). Most of the staff are helpful and friendly.  A good thing about Hawaiian is that most of their gates are at smaller terminals.  At HNL they have their own security check point so, going through security is no problem.  They also offer curbside check in some of the time.  Very convenient if you have a lot of bag.  Assigned seats and meals on mainland and international flights are included in the price.  
  -1 star because the seats on the new airbus is a bit firm."

I can't believe there is only 1 other review of Hawaiian's Las Vegas location. Do I have the wrong address????? 

Well, and for not much longer, you would arrive and depart out of Terminal 2 at McCarran International Airport. To a large degree Terminal 2 is a good thing because Hawaiian is one of a few airlines who fly out of Terminal 2 so foot traffic is less, security checkpoints are easier and shuttle bus service is available as well. 

IF you are flying the pineapple express which leaves Las Vegas at 1:55 am the downside is the terminal and counter does NOT open until 11:30 pm so if you're at the airport before then- you jus have to sit and wait. Also, the vendors up at gate are closed. 

This may not be an issue once the relocate to the new terminal"
2012-06-23,Hawaiian Airlines,R2SsWLshPYt7mAnTbLWOeA,5,"Hawaiian Airlines counter agents are the best! Here in Honolulu we requested window seats together. We were separated  because it was a last minute trip and booked late. We had two middle seats thirty rows apart!  The best they could do at first was having my gf and I across the aisle from each other. Later on at the gate we asked again and we got it!

On our flight back from Vegas same thing except this time we were together but in the middle seats. We asked for window seats and they said they'll put us on a list. Later at the gate they called us to the podium and took care of us! 

Flight attendants are the best, very good in flight service."
2012-10-04,Hawaiian Airlines,7CHSxOEQlTbgwaHrijTYGA,3,"Terminal 3 is the new home for Hawaiian Airlines and it sucks!! Bring back Terminal 2, it was sooo much more convenient. Few gates, shorter walk especially if you're older or traveling with someone who needs help.

Decided to bypass the curbside check in and go inside. Bad move, we are pualani gold members so we can stand in a separate line. The way the counter and lines are set up it's hard to tell who they are calling. Seems like only one counter is for the first class/ premier members, so the regular line might be faster.

After checking in then you go through the security then catch the tram to Terminal 2. What a hassel, then a long walk to the gate. Only pluses there are more choices to eat and not as claustrophobic as Term.2.

Got boarded, no pillows or blankets unless you want to shell out $8! Really? Good thing it was hot in the plane, or wait that's a bad thing. Flight was 9:05 am then at 9:10 the Capt comes on and says it'll be at least 10 more minutes for paperwork. Pushed off at 9:20 then sat there for another ten minutes. Finally off to the runway, took off around 9:45am. It was warm in the airplane. 

They have carts that sell headphones, blankets and upgraded meals. I opted for the $14 teri chicken and fried rice. Comp meal was a bagel and jelly or something like that.

The best thing is always the flight crew, they are the best.

Some confusion when getting luggage, they said baggage claim B or C. Then they said C, then when we went there the sign was wrong it didn't say Las Vegas so we walked all the way to B then back again! WTF, then the sign was changed. Ugh.


* When arriving in Vegas after you pick up your luggage if you choose to take the shuttle make sure you have good walking shoes. You pay inside the terminal before door 3 then you walk all the way down to door 6 to get to the shuttle. I feel sorry for the older people. Don't know why they can't park closer!"

A flying bus.  No frills.  No food service menu.  No wine list.  No toothbrushes or personal mouthwash in the lavatories.  Just horrible airline food and a very limited selection of drinks.  They even charge you for a blanket (but you can keep it).

What they lack in amenities, they usually make up for in service with some of the friendliest and warmest employees bar none.  It usually equates to a willingness to pay the 10-20 percent higher prices for domestic travel than UAL or Delta.  Usually.

Then something goes wrong (sorry this is so long)...

Departing LAS via Terminal 3 (Delta's gates).  Announcements from all other airlines can be clearly heard including those of Delta.  All good.  Hawaiian announces a delay of 30 minutes and promises an update at 5:30pm.

5:30pm:  Hawaiian agents tell people gathered around the podium that there is a mechanical issue.  Word trickles out.   NO PA ANNOUNCEMENT.

5:45pm:  Text message received from Hawaiian announcing further delay but promises update at 6:30pm.

6:30pm: ..........

7:15pm:  Flight attendants wandering around the terminal talking to groups who look like they are from Hawaii. People start to gather at the podium.  NO PA ANNOUNCEMENT.

7:30pm:  Everyone on their phone at the podium.  Better see what is happening.  Told the flight has been grounded.  Passengers must pickup luggage by a grouchy agent (""stop making me repeat myself, just follow everyone else and get your bags"").  Take a shuttle to a hotel that will leave in 15 minutes (it takes that long to get to baggage claim).  Flight rescheduled to 7am next day.  Everyone must be back at the airport by 5am.  The supervisor says they are some seats available on the midnight flight so those with high mileage status should wait.

8:00pm:  Finally speak to an agent.  No seats on any flight for three days. I know because she just told the person in front of me but still she types stuff into the computer when I'm standing in front of her just to give me the same information.  Better still ""the shuttle has left.  You need to go to XXX hotel, find a Hawaiian agent so they can get you checked in then get your meal vouchers""  Sorry, I don't play Where's Waldo.   Opt to get my own room at Mandalay Bay.

5:00am:  At the airport.  No Hawaiian agents at the counter.  No 7:00am flight listed on the departure board.

5:30am:  Still no agents.  Call 800 number.  Between the ""your flight was rescheduled?""  and the ""your last name begins with the letter U as in ...""  Hang up.

6:00am:  Agent arrives.  Flight has been rescheduled to 12:45pm. ""If you went to the hotel with everyone else you would have known that"".   When I ask why the didn't text us like they did the night before, I get told ""We don't do that"".  I show him my phone.  ""You must have sent that to yourself"".

6:15am: Agent logged in and ready to deliver excellent customer service.  I ask if the rescheduled flight is really leaving at 12:45.  ""Doubtful, the mechanic is being flown in from Hawaii and has not even landed yet.""  

Enough is enough.  Rebooked flight days later.  But there is a happy ending...

8:00am:  In taxi back to Mandalay Bay on phone with VIP host.  Within five minutes, second room booked, and upgraded to suites, immediate check in assured, and requested fresh juices and fruits to be in suite by the time we open the door.


Huge props to Hawaiian's providing generous $300 per person compensation for the problems when they are under NO obligation to do so (Department of Transportation:  http://www.usa.gov/topics/travel/air/resolve-problems/flight.shtml ).  

Shamefully poor customer service handling the problems."

The food if even offered on your flight is no frills.  Its not the best and nothing really much more to say but its exactly what first comes to mind when thinking of airlines food. If you know what I mean.

They used to be as reasonable to hop on a plane from LAS to HNL to spend some family time. However, now it's insane. I tried to book a flight to head home in March at least six months in advance and it was nearly 1000 for two round trip tickets. Sadly with the outrageous price I ended up booking a flight out of LAX to HNL for less than 400. Thanks to SouthWest I flew from LAS to LAX for 120 two round trip tickets. Still less than what I would've paid outright for a direct flight to HNL."

That's how I feel everytime I see the Hawaiian Air Las Vegas ohana... They have that island style spirit that our Hawaii is so famous for. You can tell that they miss home too, in the islands and for them, like us, it's nice to see familiar faces. Hawaiian Airlines has always been my go to carrier when traveling to the west coast and Vegas. They've since moved operations from the old International terminal and now operate out of the new Terminal 3, D concourse. Access by a high speed tram is so easy. The new digs also offer us travelers access to new shops, concessions and yes, slot machines! But getting back to our Hawaiian ohana, it helps to have friendly staff with the Aloha spirit since a lot of times we as travelers need assistance at the gates, etc. I have never felt guilty of like I was bothering any of them whenever I had a question or concern about something. Traveling can be intimidating for some, confusing to others and just downright unpleasant. It sure helps when you have a friendly face to talk to at the beginning of a long journey home and a smile. That alone will cure your anxieties! Keep up the good work Hawaiian!

Oh, and btw, be sure to download the Hawaiian Air app if you have a smartphone, it's so convenient and easy to use. Check in, change seats, upgrade, do it all from the app! You'll never be scrambling to find a computer anymore!"

Depending on what time you fly, Hawaiian is the only airline in the country that offers a complimentary in-flight meal which is cool, but for all you picky eaters, pack food/snacks for the 5-6 hour flight.

2012-04-15,Delta Airlines,ztPhuOXhhR5d0TpJ8eMWgw,3,"My only experience with Delta at LAS airport was at the gate 2 weeks ago. My friend and I were upgraded to first class, and by the time we got to the gate, the boarding for first class already happened.  My friend and I stood in the ""red carpeted"" area, behind a first class businessman passenger. This passenger told the gate agent that he had a first class ticket and asked when his turn would be to board, but the gate agent snapped at the passenger and said, ""We are NOT boarding first class right now.""  

My past experiences traveling first class on other airlines is that if a first class passenger arrives during economy class boarding, they are supposed to be let on.  I understand that the gate agent wanted to finish up the seating of that particular boarding group number, but he really shouldn't have snapped like that!  

Then on my flight, snacks were being served.  I asked the flight attendant if snacks were going to be served, and he told me abruptly in a rude tone, ""Can you please wait?"" I was just asking a simple yes/no question, but he seemed really pissy.

Granted this flight was early in the evening, and the gate agent and flight attendant were probably working towards their end of their work-shift.  This is my own speculation of why they were somewhat rude/snappy... but I shall only guess.  However, I will still fly with Delta despite the disappointment in customer service from these 2 individuals since they offer cheap flights at the (possible) cost of poor customer service."

From the flight attendants to the pilot, I always felt so welcomed on Delta flights. I'll freely admit that the coach seats are no where near as comfortable as first class, but hey! Every airline in the history of airlines is like that. I also am grateful for the wi-fi available on every Delta flight. It makes working (under a tight and/or last minute schedule) so much less stressful. It is also helpful if you get bored; what better to do on a four-hour flight than surf the Internet, or access your Itunes account to keep you occupied? Pets are also welcomed on Delta flights, and are treated just as specially as the guests themselves... OK maybe I'm exaggerating, but they are treated well. I am overall pleased with Delta's hospitality, but when I was younger, they used to serve food on longer flights, apart from the traditional peanuts and ""biscotti"" cookies. It would be an improvement to the overall experience of flying. If you have an earlier flight, you may be able to eat a light breakfast, if you have a late flight, you may have a scrumptious dinner. I know for children, it would make a world of difference. No more whining, no more kicking peoples' seats, and no more fussiness overall. I think Delta overall is a great airline to fly with, but I would recommend eating something first if you haven't had breakfast, lunch, or dinner. :)"

On my departing flight they showed Battleship on some over head tv screens which helped pass the time. On my return flight, the seats were equipped with individual tv screens with satellite tv.

Because I never see the bill when I travel to Columbus, it's tough for me to review them poorly.  Giving Delta just an average rating for the following reasons;

1.  Poor Seating:  There's minimal room on these planes and if you're sitting in the middle, good luck with that.  As we speak, I'm on the plane right now smack in middle.  Arms getting sore just typing this review out on my iPad.
2.  Ventilation: I know, most planes have poor air flow.  But it's ridiculously stuffy up in here.  
3.  No food, at least with sustenance.  I remember back in the day everyone got boxed meals on these flights.  Good thing I packed two meals.
4.  Layovers:  Probably not Delta's issue.  But it seems like I have the worst layover every time I fly out east.  Nothing is worse than flying 4 hours, stop somewhere for an hour, then take another hour to fly to your final destination.  Works a lot better if I just had a direct flight.

Some Good:
1.  Always made it to my destination safe.

Their check-in staff is beyond RUDE.  I wish I took the little miserable Filipino lady's name before I left.  Also the miserable fat lady that accompanied her.  They treated every customer terribly.  I couldn't believe Delta Airlines allowed this type of service.

Their ""e-confirmation check-in"" service is flawed.
Everyone that checked in on their mobile devices and used their economically friendly way of checking in by showing their phones instead of using a physical ticket had their tickets CANCELED! I was with a few other customers that had the same issue.  We were one hour early, but because they didn't know how to help us, it led to automatic cancellations.  That wasn't the bad part. It was their customer service, or lack of.  The lady at the desk was beyond rude.  She did not offer any solutions or even a slight sign of sympathy or concern.  The ticketing issue was their fault, and they had plenty of time to help at least 4 other people, but chose not to.  This led to customers sleeping at the airport terminals for hours hoping for an opening on the next few flights.  The experience was unreal.  I fly through this airport for business and vacationing numerous times a year and have never experienced this type of horror.  When I refused to walk away after they told me my ticket was canceled they threatened to call security.  I literally walked away in tears of frustration and watched them do the same to the other people that were robbed.

2013-04-10,Delta Airlines,_sz2VzD833vWEWftZiNWTQ,3,"Seems as if I have been taking Delta Airlines more often to Las Vegas lately than my usual go-to airline Jet Blue. It just seems to me that they have a better overall schedule of flights, prices are reasonable compared to Jet Blue, and a big sell to me is that wifi is available on their planes. Jet Blue still does not have wifi. Sure, the seats on Delta are a bit smaller and not as comfy as Jet Blue, but not bad overall.   

Wifi on a long flight from NYC helps pass the time when heading to Vegas. Screens at each seat with both tv and music selections to keep you entertained. Some of the older planes don't have in-flight entertainment so that's why having wifi is a godsend during long flights. On-board crews are usually very nice. Pretty quick deboarding and luggage pickup. I have never had any problems with Delta so far and consider myself lucky. 

Only major drawback is that they have no Delta Sky Clubs at the Las Vegas airport as they do at JFK, and the free snacks selection on Delta is totally lame compared to Jet Blue. Get with the program Delta! They do have food/snack packages to purchase though, but I'd rather get it for free, so better off bringing your own on board.

The contracted agent made my children miss their connecting flight & Delta never notified me that they were being booked on a later flight. Thank God my daughter had a cell phone to let me know that her and her little brother were being booked on flights arriving 2 hrs later to their destination. They never received the food they requested on the flight despite my daughter asking the flight attendent for sandwiches for her & her brother. They did receive water, ginger ale and pretzels. The flight attendent made it clear to me and my husband that children can order whatever they want for free. The Flight Attendent didnt assist with my air sick child. My other child and a seatmate helped. I Called Corporate and nothing was done. Brett @ Corporate offered a voucher but said unless my child was sent to another city, that's the only way I would get my money back. He stated yes, they do care for passengers but Delta is in the business of making money. I accepted the voucher once he stated I had one last chance to make up my mind to accept it or he would hang up. We are a Military family who trusted our kids with you on their first unattended flight and I'm terrified for them to return. I know it does not matter to Delta losing a customer but my family will no longer be customers!!!!"
2013-07-23,Delta Airlines,jq-3tTN0M9I0LO_QavslZA,4,Im a fan. Delta takes good care of me. I have been a loyal customer for years. Close to 1 million miles. The counter is easy to get in and out of. I just recommend that you get there early. The lines at security are long.
2013-09-08,Delta Airlines,DVvV89IbTWQeuKm1BvM07Q,1,"This was the worst customer service I've EVER experienced!!! The ladies at the gate were VERY rude and not helpful at all when I had to check my bag. Then we boarded and sat on the plane for an hour waiting for take off with no offers for beverages, etc."
2013-10-10,Delta Airlines,8FoiASsKSIX27DrdRZhj-g,2,"I was thinking about calling myself spoiled for having flown only Jet Blue and (mostly) Virgin America for the past 5 years, but in comparison this Delta flight was just as expensive only way more bush league. 

I'm gonna bullet point this one, bc I'm just too annoyed to piece this together...
-Old ass planes
-Silly boarding policy. Why make the 'Zone' system, if you call them all 10 seconds apart and then everyone stands around in the walkway. 
-Overhead entertainment. Bless you if you can pay attention to a movie on a 13 inch screen that's 6 feet away.
-Wifi...but no outlets. Vegas is 5.5 hours from NY. So, like, half the time you can rock the net.
-0 leg room (check my pic)
-Bathroom door didn't lock
-The tray table was on an angle and my lappy kept slipping on to me.
-We're still doing the peanuts and pretzels thing??? Zzzzzzz. Food options were weak. 


The whole thing seems like it hasn't changed since '86. Get it together, Delta."
2013-10-15,Delta Airlines,u5Kr1dOiA7RseUiVNKr0qg,1,"Figured I'd write a little reviewskies about the way home on my trip. 

I'll keep it simple... 
- The zone thing happened again. Getting stuck in the jetway for 10 min stiiiinks
- Gogo internet, the only modern improvement on this plane, went down 10 min into the flight. $20 and hours of gchats down the drain. 
- The pilot comes on and makes 4 announcements...
1. 'We're going to be on the runway for 35 min' (not Delta's fault)
2. 'Oh, we're missing a part to the plane and we need to document this. We'll be good to go when we get the log book back' (Please put the part back on)
3. 'There was a luggage mix-up and we're not sure what's on the plane right now' (Please put ma luggage on the plane)
4. 'Well, we got the log book back, but it seems like we have only half of the fuel to get to Las Vegas. Not sure how we made that error and we don't want to land short of LV. We'll get all fueled up and leave asap.' (Yes, enough gas to get to Vegas seems appropriate). 

90 minutes later we took off. Pilot apologizes for the 'comedy of errors', but does not apologize for the Owen Wilson movie playing. Delta fail."
2013-11-25,Delta Airlines,zdAzY71q1TcFV3MANYMXMw,3,"Delta is my go-to Airline, and those in Vegas are pretty cool people. 

Due to my being so enamoured with the slots, I nearly missed my chance to board, but with a bit of quick thinking I got in line after most of the folks were already on it.  I'd paid for the upgrade in seats, so I really didn't have an issue with leg room or baggage storage.  And since I'm a Delta/American Express card holder, I always (well, almost always )board Zone 1. 

I can't say I'm a fan of over night flights, but they're the lesser of the evils... When next I'm visiting Vegas, I'll likely be flying Delta again."
2014-01-04,Delta Airlines,cy2f5GnaNO9yo5leD6OZrw,5,"After being abused and ignored by Hawaiian, I was told by Delta's 800-number that I would not be leaving Las Vegas for 2-3 days. Now most of the time a couple of days in Vegas isn't a bad deal. But I have been on layovers and delays for two solid days. No amount of slot machines nor midget strippers will placate me. 

Then I met Sandra J at the Delta ticketing counter. She and I worked together and within 26 minutes she was able to find a seat for me to fly out. 2-3 days became 2-3 hours. She was incredibly helpful and professional. In this moment a sliver of hope was won for the airline industry's understanding of customer service."
2014-01-10,Delta Airlines,0IGdSp0truvM17xKGgWWPw,3,"Seemingly efficient and easy.  Boarding was simple and I didn't feel like we were cramming to find a space for our carry on baggage.

The WiFi is another story - The airline allows for internet access via their free wifi on the plane, however, it does not work."
2014-03-14,Delta Airlines,meO0bYjrMLUPhh8EofhFRg,3,"This Delta terminal isn't bad, but it's not good either.  Three stars for having about six mostly crappy food options and well as condensed gates and a moving walkway.  Needs more power outlets and booths and everything else they have at MSP to get more stars!"
2014-04-11,Delta Airlines,M0mWWWEymg62WvJ_aq-Gew,3,Delta is always a solid carrier I've always received good service at the gate and on the aircraft. Some of the newer planes have nice interactive media and movies .
2014-04-15,Delta Airlines,R9717xu8EAukNBIGm94NrQ,2,"Las Vegas is not a large operation for Delta and it shows. I am elite and normally, I don't have to wait a lot for dropping my luggage before a flight. Last week, I was flying a red eye out of town and there was not a huge crowd here so it should have been smooth. However, there was a single employee at the elite desk and a line of 5-6 people there moving slowly. The regular baguage drop line had maybe 20 people waiting but three employee were operating it so it seemed to move faster and the employee there said that I ""might"" have faster service there. After I was about mid-way in that line, they shifted one of the employee to the elite service which then changed the math completely, yet it was to late for me to change my mind.

Once I fatally got to drop my bag, the employee told me that my bag was ""56 pounds"" and that the limit was 50 pounds. I would have to pay an extra $100 or remove 6 pounds from it. I politely informed him that I was ""silver elite"" and that I was allowed one 70 pounds bag. They argue that it was not the case and needed to be ""gold"" or above to have 70 pounds allowed. I had done my homework before and I insisted that they checked. After about five minutes, they informed me that I was right and that their baggage system was wrong! Isn't that a basic thing to know if you work for an airline?"
2014-06-07,Delta Airlines,AqlEvxv6kDYRlRFIj7539w,1,"I'm a road warrior and fly 4 - 6 times a week. Delta as the airlines is great outside what I just experience with a specific Delta Rep and it's policy. I've always checked in via app (when available) and this week was no different. Since I was flying to area where they may not have a barcode reader, upon checking in I was required to print the boarding pass at the airport. Arrived at the airport and expecting to print my boarding pass. We'll guess what, if you didn't print it (even thou you already checked in) before the 45 minute cut off time, you are considered not checked in. To make it worst, I walked up to the priority line and immediately treated with a condescending attitude as if I didn't belong there (without asking who I am and my status). The Delta rep (Bonnie T.) who appears to be clueless on the computer best approach to what she doesn't know is telling someone to go somewhere else. She stared at the monitor so long, an opportunity to take the closes flight disappears with her blank gaze at the monitor. She had the nerve to tell me that it's my fault thou I already checked in and I needed to pay 750 dollars to fly. 
Bonnie: You are the worst representation of a rep, get some computer training and realize if it's the other way around, you would go ape sh/t."
2014-06-22,Delta Airlines,DExKCehTC3367evxpqbL3Q,4,"Have been through the airport now multiple times! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The biggest upside to this airport is the music! I have no idea where they get their music, but is just amazing. motown to Social D, I just groove along as I pass through.

Work on the trash problem ( cans are forever overflowing) and you will get 5 stars from me!"
2014-06-24,Delta Airlines,uAJQcrl2tA06qetGP5GbEA,1,"Shitty service. They made me check in my bag as I was boarding the plane because it's a ""small plane."" Then tell me why they let everyone else go on with their giant luggage and not mine? They made me stop and step to the side because apparently I ""didn't understand what they were saying."" Are you guys racist?! I told them I didn't want to check it in and they wouldn't let me move until I gave them my bag. Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline at all costs."
2014-06-30,Delta Airlines,Vy1WyC4h862n4_25i8tNCg,2,"Our flight from Detroit to Vegas was okay.  Space is a premium; didn't like that there were only 2 lavatories for 90% on the plane (economy class), and 2 for the 8% of first class.  Delta is guided by classism.
-Had garbage from the previous flight in my seat when I arrived...open soda bottle; gross!"
2014-07-03,Delta Airlines,p8cqLr2KRIfIv0OVxUEOGg,1,"I don't like their check-in policy here... I arrived an hour and ten minutes before my flight departed, waited in line 30 minutes. When it was finally my turn, the lady at the check-in desk told me I was ""too late"" and they had a policy you have to check in 40 minutes before your flight... At the time she told me this, it was exactly 39 minutes to my flight's departure yet she still couldn't check me in. ...it was the last flight of the day and I was going to see my boyfriend. It was his birthday. That's why I was in line, to check his birthday present. I realize its ultimately my fault for not arriving earlier, but regardless, I don't think I'll ever fly Delta again. No other airline that flys out of Vegas has this pointless policy."
2014-07-13,Delta Airlines,rIlL81B9eqbxUhYSeI_g-A,1,Worst Delta I've flown with. The average worker is not helpful to say the least. Flying with a buddy pass has never been more regretful than this joyous occasion today. Checking into an airport at 6am with intentions of being on a flight at 745 and them turning you away because they claim there are no seats but allowed others to get on as standby is ridiculous than to be told you'll get on the next on at 1040 and when boarding comes around you're then again told you have to wait until 1pm is quite frustrating. To deal with these frustrations you tell the attendant this is complete bullshit and she tells you to watch your mouth as though she's your mother... Can you see why I will never fly with delta again?
2014-07-15,Delta Airlines,c8hee_xKz_RadscVGuu0jA,1,"If I can give a 0 I would. I am completely distraught about delta airline pet policy. I booked a flight for my PUPPY to be shipped to me paid a passenger fee, and they give me a call literally just saying ""the flight was full of baggage and your dog could not make the flight"". I called to complain and they explained to me the policy that my pet is not guaranteed to be on the flight. WTF! Why ask me to pay a passenger fee and tell me she's not guaranteed. AND why the heck not did they disclose this to me when I purchased the ticket. Not to mention her new flight has a stop over and this whole situation can happen AGAIN! This is not okay, animal abuse is happening. My dog is expecting to be with her family. I wonder if the place they are keeping my pet is even dog friendly. She's just a puppy and part of our family. NEVER AGAIN!"
2014-07-16,Delta Airlines,n9_qTivNDo8E0sOQRBlF1Q,5,"Can't say enough great things about Delta! Had a flight booked last October to see my brother in the Air Force, he got news he would be deployed during our visit and Delta refunded the ENTIRE flight amount! No fees no hassle! Just re booked my flight now that he's back at base - was on the phone with a rep within 5 mins, booked my flight and off the phone in 13 mins! Customer satisfaction is a priority and you can tell! Couldn't be happier! Thanks for all you do Delta!"
2012-09-10,American Airlines,AUXhb_y20WD6Jk3VjL6Txg,1,"Wish I knew the name of the lady manning the ticket counter because I would put her on blast for how UNHELPFUL she was and the trouble she put us all through.

Sunday morning, arrived at McCarran to leave Vegas after a bachelorette party. We were by no means late having arrived 9:50 am for an 11:20 flight for LAX. My friends and I had checked in at the kiosk while the lone friend who had brought along a big luggage was trying to check that in as well. The minute she gets up to the front of the line, the AA worker informs my friend that her check in time has already passed and her seat may be given away to stand by. With no other vacancies on other flights, she prints out a boarding pass for a flight the next day at 7 am. We asked whether there was anything she could do to get on the same flight with us. The AA worker is neither helpful.. nor sympathetic.. a person we spent way too much time trying to reason with and plead for help. Maybe just to get us off her back, she tells us to go try waiting at the terminal and if we get lucky, our friend may be able to board as standby. She doesn't tell us anything more nor anything less and walks off. WHAT??

AA worker must have been with the airline for who knows how long.. she must have known that we can't get past TSA without a gate pass. We don't know this since we've never worked at an airline nor have we ever missed a flight. But off we go to the TSA.. HUGE LINE... we make it to the front.. where they instruct us to go right back to get the gate pass. WHAT???. With the time now at 10:50... we instruct one friend to just go and get to the terminal.. see if there was anything they can do to wait for us and at the very least.. go home back to her kid and husband. The rest of us can manage if we were to miss a flight since we don't have too important an engagement. She bolts off to the terminal.. but thats no easy feat since you would have to first board a tram that takes you for 5 minutes to the other building where then you must run about a mile and take like.. 5 escalators to get there. She makes it to the terminal by 11:10 with 10 minutes to spare before departing.. where they inform her they've already closed the gate. 

So now we've all missed our flights. No refund. No apologies. There was no way we'd stay another day so we got a rental and drove back home.."
2012-11-25,American Airlines,skkUmnSrsfkI_UlFhzco0w,2,"Again...another airline I'm not wowed by. Our plane arrived late, so we didn't board on time. The plane was WAY out of date....no TV's, old seats, etc. And again, all the food has to be purchase, nothing for free. The staff on this airline was much nicer than other ones I have been on. I'm still on the hunt for a airline that I like!"
2012-12-23,American Airlines,qxjztE_wVXl1zmrqCyAWmw,2,"I'm a loyal southwest flyer, but this time, SWA doesn't fly into itty bitty Wichita Falls, TX  so I had to fly with AA. 

The line to check in was long, but it moved fast.

The gate agent was polite and really helpful, changed my little boy and I from tiny seats in the back to the front row behind first class.

Now Isabel the flight attendant was NOT pleasant. The old woman next to me clutching her huge hand bag and service dog didn't get a word spoken to her, however me, with the 4 year old,the car seat, the stress of traveling with said 4 year old and the bag that was the SAME SIZE as the woman next to me, was told to find an storage cabinet and put it up there.

Little did she know, I didn't put it back up for landing...and we all survived!"
2013-02-17,American Airlines,vZXkjgBNWvexVX-0wRFqkg,1,"Horrible experience this last December on an international flight from Las Vegas. Spent almost 8 hours in the airport due to approx. 4 hours of flight delays with little to no information about the issue. After the 4 hour delay we were given the option to fly the following day, as we were already going to miss our connecting flight in Miami, or wait to see if the plane would take off. Luckily we left when we did, because we later learned the flight never left as there was a dent in the plane. Following the 4 hour flight delay, we got to sit for approx. 2 hours next to baggage claim waiting for our bags (that never arrived) to come up from the tarmac.Yes, it took them 2 hours, and multiple people, to realize that half of the bags were sent to connecting cities while the other half made it their owners. My husband got his bag, mine flew to Miami, and then to Brazil, which I was later told by an AA agent that this was a major safety/security violation as bags are not supposed to fly without owner. Great job AA, my bag was immediately sent to lost baggage without going through customs or clearance.

After the 8 hour delay at the airport we were compensated with a room (the least they could do) which didn't provide a shuttle to accommodate everyone, so a taxi was paid out of pocket. In addition, for the extended period of time being stuck at the airport, and the following morning's expected delay, we were given food vouchers for..... $24 for 2 people. $24 didn't even cover the cost of 2 waters and 2 sandwiches in the airport!! Needless to say we were again, out of pocket for dinner, and the following day's food before the 11am flight.

If only the problems had stopped there. Because of the mix-up in flights, and having to reschedule for the following day (in under 24 hours), we were told that food requests couldn't be guaranteed. Being vegetarians, we needed our vegetarian option on the plane but were told it couldn't be done in LV, and had to be handled at the ticketing counter in the connecting city. With flight delays, we arrived with 20 minutes to make it to connecting gate. We rushed to our gates ticketing counter to try and explain our meal situation and we were told we'd have to go to the service desk, which was about a 5min walk from our gate. Running to the service counter, and seeing about 25 people waiting in line, we tried to explain our situation of needing to arrange a meal for the upcoming 9 hour flight to a nearby AA counter and were told, wait in line. With 10minutes before boarding and 25 people in line, we returned to our gate....

I would never recommend this flight agency to anyone, sure cheap flights with no problems are possible... but is the $ worth all the lack of customer service/consideration when there is a problem? Something to consider."
2013-03-24,American Airlines,CbX5GvxBDVh6S2RuM2nTbQ,5,We were very happy to fly with American Airlines. The check in process was very quick and easy. My boyfriend and I had completely desperate seats. At the gate they upgraded our seats for us to sit together without us even asking them to do so. Awesome experience with outstanding customer service!

2013-08-20,American Airlines,wgM6cx_AS6exd3ZXcNAOtw,1,"Ewwww..  I dislike this airlines...  I only ride it because it's what the government pays for me to travel....  always delayed, uncourteous workers, seating issues...  etc, etc, etc... I don't  know how I made reservations with a confirmation code two months prior to my flight and when I get to the gate I'm on standby for a seat...  delays, delays, delays...  Hate AA!!!"
2013-09-03,American Airlines,qPq4p7oDQq1ant-vRR-qSA,1,"I would like to start off by saying that the reservations team that American Airlines has is by far one of the worst within the industry. When calling the automated  service the system doesn't understand the letter V. The when talking about changes with in my reservation. The 3 reps that handled me. Passed me on to another department like I was some washed up used person. All 3 reps wouldn't care for what I had to say. Let alone have a heart. A company like American Airlines should really value the travelers. Just when I truly thought that I found an airline that was amazing. Turned out to be a horrific experience..... 

I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. Not like this company even cares about me or anyone else that flys on AA... 
All I'm trying to do is fix my flight for my 30th birthday in SJU."

2013-12-20,American Airlines,xff6GJW3YUCmofITHJjq0Q,2,"I always fly out of Fort Lauderdale using one of their competitors. The only reason I flew out of Miami using American Airlines is because I got a great deal to Las Vegas flying with them with hotel included. The only real chagrins I have with them are finding your reservation online and checking-in early. Finding my reservation online was not the easiest of tasks which prompted me to call to make sure I was indeed booked and ready to go. As far as checking-in early, I did receive the e-mail with that option to depart MIA but, nothing for my way back from LAS. No big deal, their check-in at the airport was stress free and easy to use.

I'm not a fan of companies SPAMming your e-mail but, in this case any type of communication was non-existent for two weeks. Both to and fro. Useless stuff you don't need, however, that I did get e-mails for."

I was sitting in row eight and by the time that they got to me they already ran out of food and coca cola.  I mean really with eight rows in front of you, you run out of everything.  

They flight attendants all seem to hate there job and are so unfriendly.  I hope I dont have to fly AA again for awhile."
2014-03-25,American Airlines,DIYo-ffAacGvECuEmcb8mg,1,Don't let American Airlines screw up your vacation. Use some other airline like Jet Blue or Delta. These people don't have a clue how to run an airline. I will not use them ever again.
2014-04-02,American Airlines,saUG7xZiRhzJGVYCH2xkXg,3,"The thing to understand about American Airlines is that you have to have status to be treated well.  A long time ago I got ""Gold"" status after flying all over the country one year. I then participated in a little known program called the 10,000 mile challenge. Essentially you pay AA like $500 and try to fly 10,000 miles in 3 months. If you do it... You get Platinum status.  Now as a Platinum you can actually get upgrades and other perks that make flying AA worthwhile.  Once you have Platinum status you can essentially pay AA to keep it if you don't make the miles (but it's really expensive - like $1000 per year). Anyway, AA ain't do bad if you're a Platinum and now I've told all of you how to get it. Good luck!!"

Stupid me for not leaving them sooner but I was a loyal gold member. The last straw was the terrible service I received from AAdvantage customer service. I needed some info and got a gum chewing bimbo that really must have hated her job!

To heck with American Airlines! I now fly Southwest Airlines. Much nicer people!"

I had to cancel a flight because my grandmother passed away & American Airlines told me the only way I could get a refund or credit would be to go to the airport & show her death certificate ... Which was a pain, but I understand. However, I had the horrible misfortune of walking up to Sharon at the counter. She was so rude & said she couldn't help me & that I would have to call customer service (which I already did and they were the ones who told me I needed to go in person). So I stood there & called customer service and because I refused to leave her counter while I called, she called Airport security on me!!!! Needless to say, when Security arrived they were on my side and did nothing and when I got a customer service representative on the line, she explained to Sharon that all she needed to do was verify the death certificate for me. Sharon then proceeded to look over my grandmothers death certificate and quiz me... Asking me what my grandmother's name was and where she lived ... Etc meanwhile I was crying. Long story short-- I got the credit but I will NEVER EVER fly on American Airlines again!!!!!!! Ever!"
2014-06-21,American Airlines,JsItVDCLG3SCMWQEMOu4Yg,2,You just don't realize how nice Southwest is until you fly with these bozos. Old MD80s with tiny seats wedged together and bins that hold nothing so you have to check a carryon bag make it miserable. The crews seem jaded because everyone is miserable on the plane and they have just given up. I will do my best to avoid American

It was their fault, a plane broke down and caused a huge delay. They refused to reimburse me for my hotel reservation I missed and refused to compensate me for the hotel I had to book in Miami because they ended up giving me a flight with an overnight layover. It's cost me hundreds of dollars for their delay and a much needed day on vacation. I would pay more and fly southwest. Avoid American and spirit at all cost"
2014-07-10,American Airlines,uAATovtJwskSAhLhsUucCQ,3,"I really wanted to give 5 Stars, but I really can't. Overall, American Airlines has been awesome! I fly them more frequently than most other airlines now, and they're my ""go-to"" airline currently. BUT, I really have to say sometimes the gate agents are not very friendly. I understand how a stressful job like that can get to us at times, but it really boils down to the necessity of providing excellent customer service....always! The Las Vegas gate agents that I've encountered are just cold. Therefore, had to give 3 Stars. 

On the flip side, I've been very impressed by the customer service of other AA staff- a very helpful ticket agent in Dallas...and all of the flight crews I've seen.  

On my last flight with AA to Dallas, I was privileged to fly first class. The service was excellent the whole flight, and the food was much better than I would have imagined! Some kind of Quiche with spinach and cheese. A side of fresh fruit and a muffin. Yum! 

Even in coach they have some great snack options for purchase, most are pretty healthy. I bought the protein pack for $6 and it was surprisingly delicious! It had Nature Valley fig bars...so good! I even bought a box when I returned home."

2013-04-26,Spirit Airlines,xm6T6kqTaINFjZIr2Y0QXA,4,"I recently flew on Spirit Airlines from Phoenix/Mesa Gateway Airport to Chicago O'Hare.  Due to a death in the family, I had to book last minute travel.  While most other airlines wanted to charge me around $800.00, I decided to check Spirit Airlines.  To be honest, I was very apprehensive about flying on them due to their ""ultra low fare"" equals ""skimping on safety"" anxiety that I had.  But I was able to get a last minute fare of $370.00 (including $60.00 to join their club and another $40.00 for checked baggage both ways).   I paid for the tickets and hoped for the best.  I set my expectations very low due to the numerous 1 star ratings I saw on here and other websites, but it was the only way for me to afford making it to Chicago.  My first instinct was the purchase process was very easy and it described exactly what to expect.   I expected to pay for my checked bag, to carry only a ""soccer"" bag with ropes, the leg room to be non-existent and that the seats won't be reclining.   I also knew that I had to purchase any food or snacks on board and that I won't be able to assign my own seat unless I pay extra for it.  I checked in online 24 hours prior to departure, and to my horror, I got seat 25B, a middle seat towards the back.  So I braced for the worst.   I arrived at Phoenix/ Mesa Airport 3 hours prior to departure, parked in long-term and took the bus into the terminal.  Nothing out of the ordinary so far.  I got to the ticket counter where I saw about 4 agents waiting on 2 customers.   They were all very nice, I checked my bag without any incident. I asked if I could get a better seat if possible, and the Agent very politely changed my seat to 5D. SCORE!  I enjoyed the terminal's free Wi-Fi in comfy chairs in the baggage claim area.  2 hours prior to departure, I proceeded to the Gate for my 1:15 AM departure.  No lines at the TSA SWEET!.  In the gate area, there were plenty of electric plugs to juice my iPhone and iPad.  One hour prior to departure we began the boarding process.  The flight was pretty full.  From the outside, the plane looked fairly new, as I was looking for any signs of safety violations ( :) ).  Once inside, I was elated to find a new plane that was clean, flight attendants that looked professional in clean tidy uniforms.  The pilots looked ""experienced"" uhum, if you know what I mean.  I sat down in my seat and I wasn't surprised that there were barely any legroom, I'm 6ft, 210 lbs btw.  The flight took off on time, I watched my movie on my iPad and we landed at O'Hare on time.  I do have to say that my back began to ach due to the no seat recline, after about 2 hours into the flight.  I stretched and twisted and gave myself back-rubs until we landed (an awesome landing btw, bravo flight deck crew).  To sum it up, it was better than some experiences I had on US Airways or United.   The return flight home was just as smooth, and the Agent at the counter changed my seat from 23B to 10C SCORE!  (she did advise me that they normally charge for seat changes, but she was doing it as a one-time courtesy).  Was it worth saving $400.00 to fly on Spirit? absolutely! Will I fly them again? only if their fare is significantly lower, mainly due to the seat recline, but I was very grateful that they made it possible for me to afford making it to my family back in Chicago in a time of distress."
2013-07-31,Spirit Airlines,bcRc6T8K_rtLLDAHvbu6rA,1,"Same as another poster I wish I could give them a 0. Truly the worst airline I have ever dealt with and I fly quite a bit. I have no problem with all the fees they make it very clear what their policy is from the beginning. But that is about the only thing good in my opinion.
 I was coming home from Ft Lauderdale and there were three flight leaving around the same time,  they only had 7 agents working We were in line for over an hour just to give them our bags, we already had our boarding passes. My son was meeting me in Ft Lauderdale flying out of Mesa, Az at 12:55am and after waiting an hour and a half then sitting on the plane they pulled him and 8 other people off because of weather they said they could not get to Ft Lauderdale. They gave the people nothing except a refund or a flight the next night at 12:55am so  my son had to sit in the airport for over 30 hours to wait for the next flight. Then I found out the flight did go all the way to Ft Lauderdale when I went to the counter. So I believe they lied to my son and the 8 other people. We had plans to go to Orlando when he got in, I ended up having to cancel and losing my money, then spending more money on getting a hotel in Ft Lauderdale
I also noticed they are horrible about over booking the flights. I was on 4 different flights on this trip and there were always many people with other people already in their seats and we heard many comments from other passengers that this happens all the time. We also heard from a lot of people about them just canceling flights for no real reason and real soon to take off time.
The two planes that I was on had many broken seats and some had no tray tables. at one point the person on front of me put their seat back and was practically laying in my lap. The flight attendant just laughed and said ""yeah it must be broken"".  The shoddy maintenance inside the cabin really makes me worry about the parts we can't see. 
There are more things but I do not have time to write them all. I highly recommend NOT!!!!!!! using this airline. It really is not worth the cheaper price and really if you bring bags or want water it really is not that much cheaper."
2013-08-23,Spirit Airlines,JplpJTgiv5gyIbSiUVRQgw,1,"The worst flying experience ever, this airline is full of excuses. Pay the extra $$ and fly a bigger name Airline."
2013-08-27,Spirit Airlines,cV4pnS4gAyJKmQs1LV1zkw,1,Horrible customer service!!! Spent the last hour trying to add bags on my 80 year grandparents flight I booked for them. They said they would email me the confirmation Code but never did.  They want me to create an email address just for my grandparents bags. Crazy! Long wait on the phone with unprofessional customer service. Never again. Pay the extra few bucks and fly with a real airlines. Would score zero if possible
2013-08-28,Spirit Airlines,Ql07CMCQ7b5k5ir4ZYCQaA,1,"I would give this less of a rating, but at least 3 out of 4 flights were on time.

1: cheap my ass!! They nickel and dime you to the point where your budget goes right out the window.  $450 turns into $560 in a flash... And this includes NOTHING!

2: comfort. There is no such thing. I didn't know you could actually get seats that close to each other. 

3: shit service.   That sums it up.   Shit"
2013-10-26,Spirit Airlines,qQ4WP_TLXcCKKOdVAhlygA,1,"To echo the thoughts of other reviewers, I really feel that one star is giving this airline far too much credit. As tempting as the drastically-low-looking fare may seem, DO NOT be fooled into booking your trip on this joke of an airline. You WILL get screwed over one way or another-- I speak not only from personal experience, but from horror stories from my family members and friends unfortunate enough to make the same mistakes as I have.

The least of my problems with the airline is the overload of fees you're charged after the low-low initial rate (gas fees, taxes, fees for any bags taken aboard, water, etc.). These fees are at least posted outright from the outset of booking one's ticket-- kind of negates the whole ""budget aifare"" thing, but whatever.

What really gets me is the complete lack of customer service provided. They're not just rude, they're unethical. Like many other passengers, I have had multiple flights on this airline rescheduled or outright cancelled with no notice whatsoever. I have also been overbooked and involuntarily told that I would be getting a voucher for the next flight out; as they are a small airline, this can typically mean that you will be flying out in another 24-hours, so sorry if you have no means of transportation or a place to stay overnight. They don't care.

If you are ""lucky"" enough to get seated on one of these planes, things aren't much better. You can expect to sit for over an hour on the hot, cramped, smelly plane without any explanation, sometimes having to get off for mysterious electrical problems. The seats are cramped, tiny, threadbare, and smell like they've never been sanitized in any way, shape, or form. 

Things continue to decline after you take off into rickety flight. I'm fine with the no-frills style of flying, but this is just not caring. My mother had the last straw with these people after her last flight from Houston to Chicago. After getting up to use the bathroom and returning to find another woman sitting in her seat, she politely stepped aside to let the woman out into the aisle and allow her to walk back to the lavatories. The woman's daughter took some kind of offense and started screaming that my mother had given her a ""dirty look"" and loudly berated her to the discomfort of the entire plane. Not wanting a confrontation, my mother hit her call button for a flight attendant to no avail. Another passenger walked to the galley to physically find one of them, only to find them slumbering soundly. On a two-hour flight. We attempted to contact customer service about the incident and got no response.

This airline knows they're terrible and they justify it with their so-called cheap rates. They will take your money and do whatever they can to deny you service. Trust me, just pay the extra hundred dollars for a real airline. You'll be so much less sorry than having to deal with this hot mess of a company."
2013-11-08,Spirit Airlines,idVX3-Wd-sBgKcWdWgYSIQ,1,"Wanna know why there flights are so cheep? Its because you have to pay for everything.... even to have a carry on your flight. I got all the way through security to the gate when I realized that there was an uproar at the gate. I listened in and found out you have to pay to have a carry on bag with you. $100 to carry and bag with you? So I left the gate went back downstairs and checked my bag at the check in counter. $50 what? To carry your regular size carry on bag. I complained at the counter with the manager about being more clear that normal carry on bags are a charge and he said back ""that will be fifty dollars, cash or charge?"" I then proceeded back through security and got to my gate in time for boarding. Its not a bad thing if your prepared. It just sucks when you expect to fly cheep and end up paying non obvious fees that
 cost you more than your flight."
2013-12-18,Spirit Airlines,ICYqf_7EJsKUjLOZppLrcQ,2,"This airlines now flies out of Sky Harbor, but I would generally concur with the 2-star overall rating of this airlines. Yes, the prices are rock-bottom (even for last-minute booked flights), which is the ONLY reason anyone would ever want to consider flying with this business. Because you can expect every single flight to be delayed at least one hour. (That's been my experience after about a half-dozen flights.) And even though their website is up-to-date on flight times, if an incoming plane lands, they will quickly shuttle you onto that plane (calling ""All zones"") like scurrying rats, and you may actually leave BEFORE the time posted on their website. So beware if you think you have a boatload of time before takeoff only to find out the flight has already left the terminal when you arrive at your departure gate!

My most-recent flight  experience was like eating fresh fish from the latest oil-spill incident. The flight was (as usual) initially posted as delayed more than an hour, but that wasn't the big problem. Which occurred after the flight we were waiting on finally arrived, and we passengers were herded onto that plane like a fast-rushing river (presumably so we wouldn't arrive as late getting to our destination); where most of us then proceeded to sit on the plane - packed like 12 oz. of sardines jammed into 8 oz. cans - in just 5 airplane rows (while the rest of the seats on the entire plane were nearly empty) for two solid two hours before taking off! That, given very limited legroom on this airline, was not much fun. (Especially since we still had a 3-hour flight still ahead of us.) 

I'm not sure if this is a common practice with this airlines or not to have people sit on a plane for hours prior to takeoff, but to rush passengers onto the plane like a mad dash to get out of a burning building, and then have us sit packed together like roll of coins for two hours seemed (to me) to indicate a serious lack of good judgment on the part of the employees of this airlines; to even have the passengers board in the first place (for a flight that wouldn't be taking off for another two hours) was (in my opinion) a mistake.  

For it was only the AFTER the plane was leaving that we were told the plane (flying out of Minneapolis) suddenly needed to be ""de-iced,"" but (I ask you) wasn't this fact known to this airlines BEFORE the mad dash of passengers onto the plane? And this is what took 2 solid hours for us to finally take off? Also, we were specifically instructed not to move to other seats until after takeoff (but that turned out to be two hours later) to ""balance"" out the plane. I can tell you this, it's not the passengers who need to be more ""balanced."" 

But this sort of thing is typical with this airlines. It reminds me of public transportation, whereby standard operating procedure is run by-the-seat-of-their-pants. You get what you pay for with Spirit Airlines. So, to say the least, this latest experience of typical delays and lack of good judgment by this airlines left me with a sour taste in my mouth, the sound of the snap of the rubber glove, and the smell of a big box of week-old mackerel; and will likely be the last straw with me and this airlines, low prices or not, until they clean up their act. Let the flyer beware."
2013-12-30,Spirit Airlines,8dJ4HxwdHZUAxXZCKBwOKA,1,"This airline is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on. Not only do they nickel and dime you for everything including bags being checked and carry on's, but also any kind of drink or food on the plane, your seats, as well as even checking in at the airport. (If you check in online ahead of time and print your boarding pass, they do not charge).
My first complaint would be that at our destination they lost my boyfriends bag. Insisted that they knew where it was and that it would be delivered to our residence that night and then didn't actually get delivered to us until two days later! The second day of us not receiving any word from the airline or receiving the bag, I called and asked if they were going to even issue a credit for the charge of checking in a bag when they lost it (which is only $40 one way). They said they didn't issue credits. So I then asked if they would compensate my boyfriend for any clothing he had to buy in the meantime. They said, yes. But only up to a certain dollar amount, $50 and with receipts that you have to mail in and later wait to get money back. Needless to say I was livid by the time he finally received his luggage. And with only a $50 dollar compensation it just isn't enough with the inconvenience of not having his luggage for three days. 
Secondly, on our returning flight a flight attendant insisted that my window shade be open upon take off. Now I have never had an airline company tell me what to do with my window shade. Plus it's not against TSA or the law to have the shade down upon take off or landing. So I told her no. And she said it was against the law. When I insisted that it wasn't, she walked away. 
And thirdly, upon arriving back home, my bag was ripped in three places and my hair spray had miraculously fallen out of the ziplock baggy that I placed it in and dumped all over my clothes in my bag. At that point I figured something was going to go wrong and didn't even complain. 
If you ask me, don't ever fly on this airline. You will regret it. And it wasn't even the cheapest deal either. Southwest was $60 cheaper."
2014-01-01,Spirit Airlines,CKJsgDiiYM24DGJ9DjbTbA,1,"To give Spirit Airlines one star would be generous.   We booked flights to Cancun,  getting there the airline was over an hour and 20 mins late leaving at 2 am...no answers,  totally stressed, they held our connection due to their mechanical error. Returning to Phoenix,  they were late again.  Four different excuses, We tried to get answers so we could switch flights or even airlines.. no one knew anything.  ""I don't know"" seemed to be the only phrase anyone knew.  By the time we got any answers,  it was too late.  They overbooked all flights and the earliest return to Phoenix was Thursday,  over 5 days later. They were uninformed,  unhelpful,  rude and the worst travelling experience ever.  We cancelled and rebooked with another airline.  They got us home 2 hours early."
2014-02-27,Spirit Airlines,NGiv2icZeOmh_ENyt79F1A,4,"I booked my flight from Phoenix to Denver because of the low fares. I too was very concerned after reading the reviews. My first contact with a Spirit employee was at the Fast Baggage Drop and she was very pleasant and professional. There was no line at all so I breezed on through and headed for my gate.  The flight was not late and we boarded on time. I had no interaction with the flight attendants, but from observing them helping other passengers,  they seemed polite and professional. Granted my flight was less than 2 hours, and I am a small person, so the cramped seats didn't seem any worse than other airlines I've flown. My return flight was also just as good as the first. Some of the reviews did sound horrible for them, and I would feel the same way were they happened to me. But for me, my round trip flights were great.  I will use them again."
2014-04-07,Spirit Airlines,7LVDhJeR2OSHk5nvJzeAlA,1,"The worst airline experience I have had in a LONG time.  I am not an airline snob, by any means, but 35 min delay to start things off surely didn't help.

Customer service on the plane was good on 1 of 4 of my flights/connecting flights, all others, the attendants looked generally ticked off they had to work.

The 1 star I am giving goes all to the pilots, who were TOP NOTCH.  If I could give pilots their own rating, they'd get a 5 all day.

First time and last time customer."
2014-05-09,Spirit Airlines,IkzgCUdhnMpcKES2D7HXUw,1,"Not only was a flight delayed with a 6 hour wait at the airport (Portland, OR) but after waiting all that time it was then cancelled.  There were no seats available the following morning so a flight was booked for the next night.  Mind you there was a hotel booked and paid for at the destination location (Las Vegas).  The next night the flight was delayed 2 1/2 hours.  On the return flight two days later once again the flight was  delayed 3 1/2 hours.  I will never recommend this airline to anyone and will absolutely NEVER book a flight with Spirit Airlines. I ask myself how can an airline operate with such poor service!!!!  A star rating of one is more than what this airline deserves."
2014-06-08,Spirit Airlines,YVa-tN_OXA8JXJ9UD7XhSQ,1,"I haven't even flown yet and this airline is bothering me. The website didn't work all day yesterday.  I put in all my information. Dates and times and gave my credit card info and then it was taking hours for the information to take. It kept telling me to hang in there while my order is being processed.  I tried that 3 times and waited 2 hours for each ""processing"". And still no tickets or confirmation.  I then tried one more time hours later and the price of the fare went up by 20 dollars each way.  Ugh!!!!  I ended up on Hotwire and purchased thru them at the original price. Then you try to call them to pay for your bags ahead of time (because if you don't you are charged 100 dollars at the gate) and they tell you that to speak to an agent may cost you.  You just don't know what magical thing you say will tip them over the edge for them to charge you for their customer service.  The website is a JOKE.  I've seen my 10 year old nephew create better websites.  Nothing works, payments don't go through, it's an absolute joke, and confusing and unprofessional.  Can't wait for the trip!!"
2014-06-27,Spirit Airlines,y6WXKKeOhOPMjTX_VZBh7w,1,"I wish I had read these reviews BEFORE booking a flight. Yes, it's cheaper, but you pay for everything but ONE 16 inch carry on. The planes are tiny with no room to put your carry on under the seat in front of you. Every flight was late, which I guess they can do as they are the same planes that you connect with, so both are late. They don't let you know when to expect to board after being told the flight is late, so you don't know if you have time to potty or get food. 

The airport there isn't enough room for everyone to sit. The counter to drop your luggage didn't open until 1 hour before the flight even though the airport recommends a 2 hour window to get checked in etc. So we sat and waited for 2 hours. The gate in Ft Lauderdale was like the basement and very awkward in getting through their security. It wasn't anywhere near any food places so getting a snack after our 2 hour wait and before our 2.5 hour flight, with no food service, we couldn't get anything to eat.

On our way to Florida, we had to get off the plane at the first stop in Dallas. On the way home to Phx, we could NOT get off the plane so we were starving by the time we got to Phx.  Not very friendly people either. By the time we paid for our luggage we could have paid the extra $40 and fly another airline. That would have been the smarter choice."
